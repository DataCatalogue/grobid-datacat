AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 21% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 19% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside 
North America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional 
$20 fee for bank charges that are the result of international wire trans-
fer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit card or check payment as 
described above. CNG may reduce or compromise any charge or fee 
at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

Among the earliest of the coins of Poseidonia. A Sybarite colony founded circa 600 BC, Poseidonia grew rapidly in the 6th century through 
the exploitation of its considerable agricultural resources. This was a time of extensive temple construction and, in common with the other 
Achaian cities of southern Italy, Poseidonia began producing silver coinage of the distinctive &apos;incuse&apos; fabric in the final decades of the century. 
The fine archaic striding figure brandishing a trident is Poseidon, god of the sea and the patron deity of the city. This particular depiction of 
him is probably inspired by a colossal statue that stood in one of the city&apos;s temples.

Kaulonia was one of a number of Achaian colonies established in Magna Graecia in the seventh century BC. It is not certain whether it was 
founded by new colonists from the Peloponnesos or whether it was founded by the Achaians of Kroton. Kaulonia&apos;s coinage began in the later 
sixth century, and was one of the many incuse types that marked the beginning of coinage in Italy. Apollo, the patron deity of Kaulonia, and 
his associated iconography were the primary types featured on the coins. In the early fourth century, Kaulonia joined with Sybaris and Kroton 
in a league that was defeated by Dionysios I of Syracuse in 389/8 BC. Although the city was left intact, this event marked the cessation of its 
coinage.

Originally founded by settlers from Syracuse in 598 BC, Kamarina was dependent upon its relations with its mother-city for much of its 
history. A revolt in 553 BC left the city devastated and partly abandoned, until 492 BC, when the expansionist tyrant Hippokrates of Gela was 
granted the site in return for a peace treaty with Syracuse. Hippokrates re-founded the city a second time with groups of mercenaries from his 
many wars across Sicily, and Kamarina became a source for new recruits. It is believed that this is the time of the first coinage of Kamarina, 
with its martial design of a panoply of arms. The first period of coinage ended in 484 BC, when Hippokrates&apos; successor Gelon forcibly 
relocated its residents to Syracuse. Kamarina was re-founded a third time in 461 BC, by settlers from Gela and, at least until the 420s BC, the 
city remained attached to its parent-city. During this period, Kamarina rebuilt its akropolis defenses, public buildings, and road system. At 
least one athlete from the city, Psaumis, was victorious at the Olympics, a feat celebrated in Pindar&apos;s fourth and fifth Olympian odes. At the 
outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, Kamarina did side with Athens, although a strong pro-Spartan faction remained in the city. In 427 BC, 
Laches, who had been sent from Athens with a fleet for the purpose of bringing Sicily into the war, tried to elicit the support of Kamarina 
with a naval treaty, but the stipulation that allowed for only one Athenian ship at a time, shows that Kamarina was less than enthusiastic about 
supporting Athens. During this period, Kamarina had taken Morgantina and in 424 BC, received legal right to it as part of a peace treaty with 
Gela. Two years later, along with Akragas, Kamarina gave Athens a favorable anti-Spartan response when Athens again tried to elicit support 
in Sicily. Between 422 BC and 415 BC, both Athens and Syracuse pressured Kamarina, which remained neutral, for support. As Syracuse 
began to become the leading power on the island, when troops from Sparta arrived there in 413 BC, Kamarina offered 500 hoplites and 300 
javelin throwers as support. Soon, however, the Athenian threat was replaced by one from Carthage which, between 409 BC and 405 BC, 
conquered or destroyed the cities of Selinos, Himera, Akragas, and Gela. While preparing for a defense of Gela and a potential attack on 
Kamarina, the Syracusans compelled the citizens of Kamarina to be evacuated to Syracuse. The city virtually ceased to exist until Timoleon 
re-founded it a fourth time in 399 BC.

Leontini was founded in 729 BC by settlers from Naxos, the first Greek colony in Sicily, which itself had been established just a few years 
earlier. In the first decade of the 5th century the city was captured by the tyrant Hippocrates of Gela whose successor, Gelon, transferred his 
seat of government to Syracuse in 485. Thereafter, Leontini usually remained within the Syracusan sphere of influence though its 5th century 
coinage was on a considerable scale, attesting to the independent wealth of the community. A major political change took place in the late 
460s -the expulsion of the tyrants and the restoration of democracy. This was reflected on the Leontine coinage by the introduction of new 
types featuring the head of Apollo on obverse and a lion&apos;s head on reverse. Apollo was especially revered at Leontini, as he was at the mother 
city of Naxos where there was a famous sanctuary of Apollo Archegetes. The lion apparently represents a punning allusion to the city name. 
The surrounding barley-grains are indicative of the exceptional fertility of the Leontine territory and doubtless refer to the local worship of 
Demeter, the goddess of agriculture.

The colony of Zankle was founded by Cumaean and Euboean settlers in the eighth century BC on the straits of Messina. Its name, meaning 
&quot;sickle&quot;, was taken from its important sickle-shaped harbor. The colony prospered and even founded its own colonies at Mylae and Himera. 
Zankle was soon overshadowed by Rhegion, though, whose tyrant, Anaxilas, seized the colony around 488 BC and renamed the city Messana, 
after Peloponnesian Messenia, whose colonists he settled in Zankle.

In the Hirsch sale of the Berlin duplicates, this coin received a rare lengthy note: 

Euböische Drachme von wundervollem Uebergangsstil. Cabinettstück ersten Ranges. Avers und Revers einzigartig im Raume stehend. 
Pracht-exemplar, wohl das schönste der bekannten Exemplare und deshalb von grösster Seltenheit. [Euboean drachm of wonderful transitional 
style. Choice example of the first order. Obverse and reverse superbly well centered and struck. Magnificent example, probably the finest of 
the known specimens and therefore of the utmost rarity.] 

On the day of the sale, the coin hammered at 2225 DM, an exceptional amount for a drachm, and the same price that the Berlin Museum&apos;s 
Naxos tetradrachm of Cahn 54 type realized in the same sale. 

Located on the eastern shore of Sicily in the shadow of Mt. Aitna, Naxos was the oldest of the Greek colonies on the island, founded in 735 BC 
by colonists from Chalkis in Euboia and Ionia. According to the historian Thucydides (1.100), Naxos established its own colony by founding 
Leontini in 730 BC, which was soon followed by the foundation of a second colony, Aitne, later known as Katane. Owing to the fertility of 
the surrounding volcanic soil of Mt. Aitna, Naxos developed an economy of viticulture, and along with Leontini and Katane, became very 
prosperous. This wealth attracted the attention of Syracuse, which subjugated Naxos in 476 BC, removing its citizens along with those of 
Katane to Leontini. Upon the death of Hieron in 461 BC, the Naxians were reinstated to their original city, and formed a close alliance with 
Leontini and Katane. During the first Athenian Expedition in 427 BC, Naxos actively provided support to the Athenians, who had sent a large 
fleet to support the allies against Syracuse. In 409 BC, Naxos sided with Syracuse against the Carthaginian threat to Sicily, but in 403 BC, the 
tyrant Dionysios of Syracuse turned against the Naxians, destroying the city and selling the women and children into slavery. 

The present issue is composed of multiple denominations in silver, and is dated by Cahn to the first few decades after the refoundation of 
the city in 461 BC. Some theorize that it was struck upon the refoundation as a celebratory issue, but one wonders whether the city had the 
resources for such a coinage so soon. It could also have been struck somewhat later, after the city had prospered from its trade ties to Kamarina 
and Leontini, and could afford to employ the skilled artisan(s) this magnificent issue required, as well as supply the requisite silver for such a 
large output. The types found on the drachms are the same as that on the famed tetradrachms (Cahn 54), and the style of each are so close that 
it is likely they were engraved by the same hand. The obverse features Dionysos, the god of the vine, on the obverse, as wine was the primary 
export for which Naxos was well known, and it provided great wealth for the venerable polis. The reverse is also an allusion to wine and the 
Dionysiac cult, featuring the satyr Silenos. Half-man, half-goat followers of Dionysos, these satyrs were often depicted in an ithyphallic state 
as they pursued the god&apos;s female attendants, the mainads. Silenos was the oldest, wisest, and most drunken of the satyrs, and according to 
Euripides&apos; only surviving satyr-play, the Cyclops, he had been forced to attend to Polyphemos, who dwelled in the region of Mt. Aitna, and 
hence another reason for its use on this coin of Naxos.

By the late 5th century BC, Syracuse had become the most significant of the Greek cities in Sicily, and her political and cultural power was 
reflected in her massive issues of coinage still extant today. Her status drew a plethora of highly skilled artists from around the Mediterranean, 
including an assortment of particularly capable die engravers whose names adorned the coins of this period. These masters developed new 
ways of viewing the world through art, breaking the static forms of Classic art and developing new methods of portraying motion and life 
in miniature. The silver tetradrachm was the preferred mode of expression, being large enough for their free-ranging talents and also being 
minted in vast quantities for military endeavors that would disseminate their works far and wide. Even more remarkable were the large silver 
dekadrachms of Syracuse, which have become universal symbols of Greek numismatic art. Among the famous artists, only two have their 
signature on the dekadrachms, Euainetos and Kimon. Whether chosen for their skill or by chance, their body of work clearly proves that these 
two were the elite among numismatic artists. 

This masterful facing head tetradrachm, however, sets Kimon apart from all of his contemporaries. His rendition of the nymph Arethusa 
displays a degree of delicacy and control that set a new precedent in die engraving. The composition&apos;s beautiful three dimensional perspective 
is augmented by a fluid style that effectively conveys the natural motion of the nymph&apos;s hair in her liquid environment. The nymph&apos;s 
underwater environment is further emphasized by the placement of the dolphins, who weave themselves within her hair in a playful manner. 
The serenity of Arethusa&apos;s countenance, with her full, pouting lips and other-worldly gaze from her almond-shaped eyes, conveys a sense of 
her place aloof from the realm of man, while the entire scene firmly secures her within our natural world. One may sense the pride Kimon took 
in the completion of his masterpiece, as his name is prominently engraved upon Arethusa&apos;s ampyx. 

We know that Kimon&apos;s tetradrachm was as revered for its beauty in the ancient world as much as it is today, as it became a model for facing-
head issues of other cities, both local, such as Segesta, and around the Mediterranean, such as Larissa in Thessaly and Tarsos in Cilicia.

Dionysios assumed power in 405 BC and immediately set out to make Syracuse the greatest and best fortified city in all of Greece. He was 
defending against the renewed imperialistic expansion of Carthage. Three times he defeated the Carthaginians, bringing further prestige and 
wealth to Syracuse. During his reign, the Syracuse navy became the most powerful in the Mediterranean, allowing Syracuse to expand her 
territorial control over much of southern Italy. 

Dionysios reintroduced the large and ostentatious silver dekadrachms, a denomination that had not been used in Syracuse since the Demareteion 
issue decades earlier. Dionysios entrusted two of the greatest local numismatic artists, Kimon and Euainetos, to design these impressive pieces. 
The regard for these coins in modern times is reflected by the fact that they are considered a must for any first rank collection of Greek coins.

These coins were originally attributed to the Punic mint in Spain, but subsequent hoard evidence has established that they were struck either 
in Carthage or a Carthaginian mint in Sicily during the Second Punic War (see A. Walker, &quot;Some Hoards from Sicily and a Carthaginian Issue 
of the Second Punic War&quot; in Studies Mildenberg, p. 275, and note 6). Burnett (Enna) argued, based on the fixed die axes of the coins, that this

This series was a development in the coinage at Olbia following the expedition of Perikles to the region. During this expedition, Perikles 
promoted the democratic style of government, and removed aristocracies and oligarchies from power at a number of the cities, which were 
then brought into the Delian League. This event is reflected on the new series at Olbia in three ways. First, the name of the magistrate, who 
had been part of the ruling oligarchy, was removed from the coinage. Second, the obverse type was changed to a facing gorgoneion, which 
was emblematic of the protecting cuirass of Athena (Athens). And finally, the reverse shows a dolphin in the talons of Zeus&apos;s eagle. This 
reverse type is particularly significant, as the dolphin, long a symbol of the cult of Apollo Delphinios, whose leaders were members of the 
oligarchy, was now depicted under the influence of Zeus, whose cult was ascendant under the democratic government, when he was known as 
Zeus Eleutherios (cf. Y.G. Vinogradov, Pontische Studien: Kleine Schriften zur Geschichte und Epigraphik des Schwarzmeerraumes [Mainz, 
1997]: 212-5).

Abdera has its mythological foundation in the Labors of Herakles, who founded the city in honor of his companion Abderos after the latter 
was killed by the mares of Diomedes. Historically, the first recorded settlement was a failed colonization effort by Klazomenaians under the 
leadership of Timesias in 656 BC, but neither of these events have left any concrete traces in the later history. It was in 541 BC that citizens of 
Teos, fleeing the Persian conquest of Ionia, established a long-lasting civic entity. The unchanging numismatic symbol of Abdera, the griffin, 
was adopted from the coinage of the lost home city, Teos, but turned to face left instead of right as at Teos. Abdera&apos;s production of massive 
silver oktadrachms begins within a decade of the founding of the city, and reflects the reason for the success of this foundation as opposed to 
the earlier failure; at the beginning of the 6th century BC the prolific silver mines of Thrace started coming on line, and trading cities such as 
Abdera and Thasos were well positioned to claim their portion of the wealth. While producing large quantities of silver coins, the city also 
introduced one of the earliest series of signed coinage by annual magistrates. While the obverse type was invariably a griffin, the reverses, 
once they evolved beyond the simple quadripartite square in the late 5th century, seem to have been left to the whim of the magistrates, who 
responded with a delightful repertoire of varied types, mythological and naturalistic, a number featuring visual puns on the magistrate&apos;s 
name. This was the period of Abdera&apos;s greatest achievements, of well known citizens such as Demokritos, the &apos;laughing philosopher&apos;, and 
Protagoras, the most celebrated of the sophists. The failed revolt against Athens in 411 BC proved only a slight hiatus in the city&apos;s prosperity. 
However, the final end would come within a generation, as the production of the Thracian silver mines began to slow (or was diverted to 
the growing power of Macedon) and the Thracian tribes became increasingly restive. In 375 BC, the Abderan army was destroyed by the 
Triballoi, and only closer confederacy with Athens preserved the city. Its annual coinage issues ceased, and after this period little precious 
metal coinage was struck in Abdera. By the time of the coming of the Romans in the 2nd century BC, the great trading city of Abdera had 
sunk into permanent obscurity.

Ainos came rather late to currency production, striking its first tetradrachms only after the expulsion of the Persians from northern Greece 
following Xerxes&apos; defeat at Salamis. Its first period ended with the Athenian coinage decree of 449 BC, but the mint was in operation again 
by circa 435 BC, tapering off rapidly until disappearing with the conquest of the city by Philip of Macedon in 342 BC. Its uniform types 
throughout its history were Hermes and the goat, the latter the symbol of the pasture land that provided what prosperity Ainos had. Hermes 
was the patron deity of Ainos, dating from the time of the Trojan War. According to a poem by Kallimachos, the sculptor Epeios, who 
constructed the Trojan Horse, also made a wooden statue (ξοανον) of Hermes, which was washed out to sea and recovered by fishermen by 
the Hebros river. The fishermen, thinking it just a piece of driftwood, tried to burn it in their bonfire. When it failed to burn they took fright 
and threw it back into the sea, which promptly cast it back again. The natives accepted it as a relic of the gods, and erected the sanctuary of 
Hermes Perpheraios (the Wanderer) at the future site of Ainos. The later coins of Ainos showcase some of the finest numismatic art of the 
Greek world. Nevertheless, Ainos never became an important city or trading center. The climate might have had something to do with it; 
according to Athaneus, Ainos had two seasons, eight months of cold and four months of winter. At least the goats liked it.

Ritual abduction as a form of exogamy was, and is still, frequent in tribal society. The reference here is probably to the Dionysiac cult and is 
modeled on one of the stone reliefs for which Thasos is famous. For another archaic treatment on the same theme from Delphi, see Boardman, 
Greek Sculpture: the Archaic Period, fig. 210. 

The overtly sexual displays seen on many early Greek coins can be disconcerting to the modern eye, viewing them through the lens of 
centuries of Christian fulminations against &apos;paganism&apos; and its erotic excesses. These scenes are at their most graphic in northern Greece, for 
example, on the archaic coins of Siris and the island of Thasos, showing the interplay of nymphs and satyrs. The towns and tribes of this region 
were only newly introduced to the &apos;civilizing&apos; influences of the south, and were still close to their roots in farming and herding cultures. Their 
gods were not the Olympian super beings, but the spirits of nature, and the emphasis was on celebrating the fecundity of fields and flocks.

While previous scholars viewed Skostokos as a dynast who took control of parts of Thrace following Lysimachos&apos; death, Fischer-Bossert&apos;s 
die study demonstrates that Skostokos was most likely a local ruler, under Lysimachos, who was permitted to strike these coins near the end 
of Lysimachos&apos; reign. This particular coin was struck from the first reverse die to add Skostokos&apos; name.

The Ghazzat Hoard 

CNG is pleased to present this hoard of 27 Greek coins -The Ghazzat Hoard -found in the sea off the coast of Gaza in the 1960&apos;s. The coins 
have been consigned by the Tarazi family, who acquired the coins immediately after they were found. In recognition of the significance of 
this hoard, the Tarazi family has requested that the coins be sold as one lot, in order that the coins can be kept together for further study and 
the benefit of scholarship. The family has retained two coins (two Delphi tridrachms, out of a total of four in the hoard) as family keepsakes. 
Thus, the present offering consists of 27 coins out of a total of 29 that comprised the complete hoard. 

Khader Joseph Tarazi, who passed away in 2014, was a prominent member of the Palestinian Christian community in Gaza. He was the owner 
of a gold and metal shop, called Al-Tarazi, in downtown Gaza, and he was known as a buyer of coins and antiquities. 

Mr. Tarazi&apos;s daughter, Rawia Khader Tarazi, has related the history of the hoard: 

My father had a big passion for collecting…. He loved antiques from all periods…. These pieces [The Ghazzat Hoard] came from a fisherman 
called Haj Salama and my father bought all the pieces. [Haj Salama] had a boat and stand at the fish market, Hesbt El Samk on el Bahr 
Street… [My father] knew they were important and only until my son looked at the Internet a few years ago we realized that they are extremely 
important. 

On 5 December 1967, Mr. Tarazi deposited the coins for safekeeping with Penyot Khair, the priest at St. Porphyrius Church of Gaza (within 
the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem). The church acted as a repository for valuables and was regularly used by the community for 
safekeeping. Mrs. Tarazi, who was six-years-old at the time, recalls the circumstances: 

The Christian community was always a minority and the Church was responsible for handling all Christian affairs and it was common to 
keep valuable pieces in the Church. There were no banks or safe places to keep items. The times were difficult and not secure. Many times we 
would not be allowed to go outside after 3PM or 7PM or sometimes for the whole day. My father would travel a lot and leave us alone and 
this was the safest place to store our valuables. 

The coins were left with the Church from 1967 until 2005. On 2 March 2005, the Coins were released to Mrs. Tarazi by the Greek Orthodox 
Patriarchate of Jerusalem and were collected from St. Porphyrius Church. The family recognized the significance of the coins while Mr. Tarazi 
was still alive and had intended to have the hoard published. Mrs. Tarazi adds: 

We are very thankful to the Orthodox Church of Gaza for supporting us and all the Christian community. My father left us many things 
before he died last year and he had many hopes for these coins and unfortunately we are sad that he will not be able to see them published by 
academics… and sold to a collector or museum. 

The hoard itself includes a remarkable variety of types from different areas of the Greek world. The composition is parallel to the Asyut 
Hoard, which contained many of the same or related issues. The closure date for the Ghazzat Hoard (ignoring the single late 5th century 
Athens tetradrachm that must be an intrusion) appears to be circa 480-475 BC, around the same time as Asyut. The Ghazzat and Asyut Hoards 
together, along with other famous hoards such as Zagazig, may now be considered to illustrate the extent of trade in the eastern Mediterranean 
in the early 5th century, although the differences in these hoards may also be informative. For example, Ghazzat is lacking the Aegina issues 
that made up more than 10% of both Asyut and Zagazig. A detailed study of the Ghazzat Hoard may not only increase our understanding of 
trade patterns but also contribute to the refinement of dating for these hoards and their contents. 

CNG is most grateful to Archbishop Alexios of St. Porphyrius Church in Gaza, in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, for searching 
the Church archives and providing supporting documentation and photographs. Copies of the Church documents provided by Archbishop 
Alexios will be provided to the purchaser of the lot and are available to interested bidders by request prior to the auction.

This coin is the same weight as the piece Noe listed as having been seen in commerce for his no. 89. Judging from the rarity of this issue, this 
coin may be the coin seen by Noe, and thus would be from the 1913 Kalliandra Hoard (IGCH 358). 

The city of Mende, located on the Pallene Peninsula on the eastern shore of the Thermaic Gulf was, according to Thucydides (4.123.1), 
founded by Eretria in the 8th century. It later founded colonies of its own: Neapolis on the eastern coast of Pallene, and Eion at the mouth of 
the river Strymon near Amphipols. Mende&apos;s wealth is indicated by the high amounts of tribute paid to the Delian Confederacy: eight talents 
until 451-450 BC, and then amounts ranging form five to nine talents after 438-437 BC. During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) Mende 
originally sided with Athens, but then, on the urging of the oligarchs, went over to the Spartan general Brasidas. It eventually returned to the 
Athenian side, but is not mentioned in connection with the Peace of Nicias. From 415-414 BC, Mende again appears in the Athenian Tribute 
Lists, but by the fourth century the city was only minting copper coins. 

The Dionysiac types of Mende proclaim it as a famous wine producing city, as attested by its amphoras that have been found throughout the 
Mediterranean. On this delightful coin, Dionysos, who rules wine and winemaking, is shown being carried home drunk from a symposium, in 
a state of careless joy that links the world of men with the Olympians -at least until the morning.

In his 1988 article on Rhodian imitations, R. Ashton has argued persuasively that this coinage was struck by Perseus to pay Cretan mercenaries 
serving in his army (see &quot;A Series of Pseudo-Rhodian Drachms from Mainland Greece,&quot; NC 1988, pp. 29-30). The Rhodian coinage circulated 
on Crete, where it was a familiar and trusted currency for the Cretans, and it is likely that they would have required payment in that form (see

This coin is the only genuine stater of Alexander the Molossian to have been offered for sale over the past 75 years; the Leu 52 piece was 
withdrawn as a modern forgery. 

Alexander the Molossian, in 334 BC, was invited by Tarentum to defend the city against the Samnites, Brettii, and Lucani of central Italy. 
While Alexander accepted their appeal, the true purpose for his intervention was to extend his dominion in the West just as his namesake, the 
king of Macedon, was establishing a great empire in the East. After initial successes, his career was abruptly terminated in 330 BC beneath the 
walls of Pandosia where he perished in battle against the Bruttians, much to the relief of the Tarentine Republic. Alexander honored Zeus of 
Dodona, the central deity of the Molossians, on his coins. The sanctuary of Zeus Naïos at Dodona was reputed to be the oldest Greek oracle, 
and was known to Homer.

From the BCD sale (Triton XV): &quot;The ΠΛΕΙ drachms and their fractions constitute an intriguing departure from the mainstream material that 
comes after the Early facing heads. Their date must precede most, if not all, Middle and Late facing types, also because all fractions have their 
obverse in profile. The size of the letters precludes the possibility that they are an artist&apos;s signature and if there was a mint in Thessaly starting 
with these letters, it could be claimed they are a joint issue. Perhaps they are a special group minted for a particular purpose and subsidized 
by a rich sponsor whose name starts with these letters. Thomas R. Martin, in his article &quot;The Chronology of the Fourth-Century B.C. Facing-
Head Coinage of Larissa&quot; in Museum Notes 28 (1993), p. 31-32, esp. notes 108 and 109, conjures up a Tyrant (archon) whose name did not 
come down to us and who seized power in Larissa for a short time, around 375 BC. It would be nice if an inscription was found that confirms 
this theory, but for the time being, as Martin himself admits, it can only be speculation.&quot;

($750) 

From the BCD Collection. 

BCD comments: If the average wear of the Thessalian Confederacy Apollo/Athena Itonia bronzes is taken into account, one could 
hypothesize a time for these countermark applications during the late first or early second century AD. However, it is interesting to 
observe that one of these pieces has seen much less wear than all the others of the same type (a point to remember when a solitary coin 
of a particular type in a hoard provides a convenient date for the concealment of the entire hoard). Two more observations are worth 
recording: the civic coins, as a whole (including Amphipolis and Pella, the only non Thessalian mints), are generally better preserved than 
the Confederacy bronzes. It is generally assumed that the civic bronzes were minted before the Confederacy issues, although recent research 
suggests that the two types of coins were almost contemporary. Nevertheless, it would be safe to say that, for almost the same period of time, 
the latter saw much more circulation and handling than the former. Also, at least one of the coins that bear both countermarks clearly shows 
that the &quot;owls&quot; were applied after the &quot;wheat ears&quot;. 

We know that in AD 99, Trajan ordered that grain be sent from Rome to Egypt. It could well be that during that time a compulsory grain 
donation was enforced on some Thessalian farmsteads that showed a surplus for the season. This would be a convenient way for the local 
officials to obtain the emperor&apos;s favor at no cost to themselves. A practically valueless piece of metal countermarked with a wheat ear would 
be exchanged with a specific quantity of grain delivered for export. If this was a promise to pay the bearer some real money in the future, 
it probably never materialized. The owl countermarks, either on their own or applied in addition to the wheat ear are harder to explain. 
Probably a &quot;second round&quot; of donations that, for some reason, had to be recorded separately from the first. ASW has suggested a quantity 
of livestock such as a number of live chickens, but this seems a little far-fetched.

There are times when some of us wonder what the world would be like today if Alexander the Great had lived to a ripe old age. The same kind 
of &quot;What if ...&quot; thinking could be applied to Epaminondas. His premature death on the battlefield of Mantineia in 362 BC deprived Thebes of 
its greatest statesman and soldier, signalling the start of Thebes&apos; rapid decline into obscurity. If Epaminondas had lived to reap the benefits of 
his Mantineian victory, he would have undoubtedly proceeded to unite all Greece under his leadership. The next step would be to turn to the 
North and face Philip who, instead of finding a divided Greece ready for the taking, would think twice before attempting to invade Thessaly. 
Whether then there would be a clash between the two emerging superpowers or a truce between them, is anybody&apos;s guess. Perhaps Philip 
would remember the years he spent as a hostage in Thebes and his respect for the Theban statesman would prevail. The conquest of Asia would 
then materialize sooner and in a more permanent manner. But, like many great soldiers, Epaminondas inspired his men by leading them into 
battle and, instead of capitalizing on his genius, Thebes paid the price for his bravery.

This coin is part of a multi-denominational series of coins struck at Pantikapaion in the early 4th century BC. Based on the legend, numismatists 
once attributed these to a city of Apollonia in the Bosporos, but later research has shown that these are likely issues of Pantikapaion that are 
associated with that city&apos;s famous temple of Apollo Prostates. All of these issues have parallel types in the coinage signed with the ethnic of 
Pantikapaion; see the previous lot for the issue parallel to the present piece.

Pantikapaion was founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh century BC. Situated on the west side of the Cimmerian 
Bosporos, in what is now called the Crimea, it achieved great prosperity through its exploitation of the abundant fisheries of the straits and the 
export of wheat from the Crimea. This wealth is attested by its splendid gold coinage, which commenced in the mid-4th century BC, and by 
the magnificently furnished rock tombs of its principal citizens in the same period. Later, it was to become a regional capital of the kingdom 
of Mithradates VI of Pontos (120-63 BC) and later still the seat of the kings of Bosporos (first century BC -fourth century AD). The coinage 
of Pantikapaion seems to have commenced with silver issues in the latter part of the fifth century BC, but it is for its beautiful gold staters that 
the mint is chiefly noted. They depict the head of the god Pan (a pun on the name of the city) and on the reverse the griffin that Herodotos 
describes as being the guardian of the remote sources of gold.

From the Friend of a Scholar Collection, purchased from Platt, September 1980. 

Mithradates is the Hellenistic monarch par excellence, his career driven by megalomaniacal ambitions leading to murderous assaults upon 
family and followers and disastrous foreign adventures against superior forces. His idealized portraiture attempts to mimic the gods with its 
bold staring gaze and unruly, free-flowing hair, but at its most extreme is a personification of hysteria in its Dionysiac sense. The wreath of ivy 
on the reverse reinforces Mithradates&apos; link with the god as well as making a connection with the cistaphoric coinage that circulated in the area. 
The stag probably represents the civic center of Ephesos and the mintmark is of Pergamon, all part of the new Pontic kingdom, symbolized 
by the star and crescent. His empire collapsed before the armies of Sulla and Lucullus, and Mithradates ended his own life in exile in the far 
region of the Crimea, pursued to the end by vengeful Romans and family.

The Electrum Coinage of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), which 
constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now being 
continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by von Fritze in 1914, augmented 
(and corrected) by the articles by Hurter and Liewald. More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of 
Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that 
the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

Second Known Symmachy Issue

($30,000) 

From the MPM Collection, acquired in 1928. 

The British Museum acquired the only known example of this type from a dealer in Rhodes in 1927 (cf. N. Hardwick in QT XXV [1996]), 
as part of a group of four coins that had been found together. As the present coin was acquired by the consignor&apos;s grandfather in 1928, it is 
possible that it was part of the same find that contained the BM coin. A comparison of color photographs of the two coins reveals a similar 
surface appearance that is consistent with coins from a common hoard. 

At the turn of the fifth to fourth centuries BC, several important cities in western Asia Minor -Byzantium, Knidos, Kyzikos, Ephesos, Iasos, 
Lampsakos, Rhodes, and Samos -struck an issue of silver denominations bearing on the obverse the figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon 
-the infant Herakles strangling a pair of serpents -along with the Greek letters ΣYN, generally interpreted as syn[machoi] (allies). The 
significance of the figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon, which was the badge of this alliance has been the subject of significant debate, 
especially in establishing the chronology of this short-lived alliance. 

The figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon was depicted in Greek art from the first half of the 5th century BC and represents an important event 
in the early life of the Greek hero. The birth of Herakles, son of Zeus and Alkmene, enraged Zeus&apos; wife Hera, who tried to kill the infant by 
sending two serpents to strangle the sleeping baby in his crib. The following morning, the nurse discovered Herakles playing with the serpents&apos; 
lifeless bodies: he had strangled one in each hand. The use of this image as the badge of the alliance is significant. Karweise in his article, 
&quot;Lysander as Herakliskos Drakonopnigon (NC 140 [1980], pp. 1-27) argued that the infant Herakles probably represented the Spartan admiral 
Lysander, whose defeat of the Athenians at Aigospotamoi in 405 BC effectively ended the Peloponnesian War. Lysander was a member of the 
Heraklidai -direct descendents of Herakles -and the use of the figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon would have particularly apt, given that 
Spartan power was now on the rise, having &quot;strangled&quot; that of Athens. Thus, for Karweise, these coins should have been struck shortly after 
the end of the war -about 404 BC. This interpretation continues to be offered when the coinage is discussed (see Sitta von Reden, Money in 
Classical Antiquity [Cambridge, 2010], p. 80) 

Dismissing the figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon as just a contemporary type in favor of the significance of the Greek letters ΣYN, and 
beginning with those issues of Rhodes with figure of Herakliskos Drakonopnigon, but without the Greek letters ΣYN, Delrieux argued that 
the alliance of these cities occurred in two brief phases -the first circa 395-390 BC, when Rhodes became the base of operations for the 
Athenian general Konon and his ally, the Persian general, Pharnabazos, against the Spartans. In 394 BC, following the defeat of the Spartan 
fleet at Knidos, many cities north along the Ionian Coast, including Ephesos and Samos, joined this alliance, which continued through to at 
least 390 BC when Sparta reasserted control in Asia Minor. The second phase began circa 389-387 BC. At that time, the Athenian general 
Thrasyboulos, who replaced Konon as commander (he had since been imprisoned by the Persians), began re-establishing Athenian alliances 
with those Asia Minor cities that had previously been their allies (many of these cities once belonged to the Delian League). The result of this 
action was Spartan fear over a resurgent Athenian empire, prompting counter-attacks against the cities of the Hellespont and the Propontis. 
To protect themselves from these attacks, these pro-Athenian cities allied themselves. With the King&apos;s Peace in 386 BC, however, this second 
phase of the alliance was no longer necessary: the alliance broke up and ceased striking this coinage.

Unpublished Electrum Issue 

168. 
MYSIA, Uncertain. Possibly a colony or outpost of Kyzikos. 5th-4th cenutries BC. EL Stater (18.5mm, 16.05 g). 
Phokaic standard. Forepart of Pegasos left, legs splayed forward; below, spearhead left / Quadripartite incuse square of 
windmill pattern with stippled quarters. Unpublished. Choice EF. Unique. 
($25,000) 

At first glance, the Pegasos forepart left on an electrum stater suggests an issue of Lampsakos. That city did strike a well known series of 
electrum staters featuring this exact type over a long period. However, other aspects of this coin suggest it has nothing to do with these 
Lampsakene issues. First and foremost, the weight of this piece appears to belong to the Phokaic standard of 16.1 grams to the stater, used 
for electrum at Phokaia, Mytilene, and Kyzikos, while the issues of Lampsakos were on the Milesian standard of 14.1 grams. There does not 
appear to be any time at which Lampsakos ever used the Phokaic standard for any of its coinage. Second, the windmill style incuse here is 
exactly of the type used at Kyzikos; the staters at Lampsakos have the more canonical quadripartite incuse with thin dividing lines and quarters 
that are uniformly depressed. Finally, on the Lampsakos electrum staters, the appearance of Pegasos is exactly consistent across all issues, 
showing the legs folded below. The splayed form of Pegasos&apos; legs here is not consistent with this model. At Kyzikos, though, there are some 
issues depicting the forepart of a mythological creature with the forelegs splayed as here (see, e.g., von Fritze I pl. II, 7 and 24). 

Accordingly, the present coin is consistent in weight standard, obverse style, and punch design with the electrum coinage of Kyzikos. 
However, it is lacking the civic badge of Kyzikos, the tunny, which is present on every known electrum issue of that city from the 6th through 
4th centuries BC. The absence of a civic badge also discounts an issue from Phokaia, which did strike a couple staters early in its coinage, but 
not without some form of a seal or griffin appearing on the coin. The final electrum-issuing city that used the Phokaic standard, Mytilene, is 
also highly unlikely. It never issued staters, and its incuses always took the form of some creature or deity. 

While the attribution of this coin remains tentative, its connections to the Pegasos type of Lampsakos, and to the weight standard and 
distinctive incuse of Kyzikos, clearly locate the mint in Mysia. We might suggest a colony or outpost of Kyzikos, perhaps striking with 
influence from a Lampsakene element, while the spearhead may indicate a military context. The similarities to the coins of Kyzikos and the 
high quality of engraving may suggest that the issuer was employing Kyzikos mint personnel. Further research is needed. A close study of the 
literary record may identify historical circumstances that could account for the characteristics of this coin. At the same time, a comprehensive 
comparison of the present reverse to the known Kyzikos reverses might identify a match that would prove a Kyzikene connection.

The Electrum Coinage of Mytilene and Phokaia 

By the last quarter of the sixth century BC, the voluminous electrum hektai issues of Mytilene and its neighbor Phokaia in Ionia were being 
struck on an annual or semi-annual basis as &quot;contributions&quot; to either the Persian empire or the Delian league, depending on the political 
climate. The source of their wealth was the profitable trade between the Aegean and the resource-rich Black Sea coastal cities, and even 
the growing dominance of Athens and its &quot;owls&quot; did not dislodge the hektai as the preferred coinage of the northern littoral of the Aegean. 
Popular as a widely circulating trade currency, the electrum hektai remained in widespread use for a period of over two centuries. The art of 
early hektai demonstrated a clear connection to the technique of gemstone engraving, with a marvelous compaction of detail in a small area 
and the use of bas relief and intaglio engraving. The incuse reverse types of Mytilene show a sophisticated understanding of small scale die 
cutting, employing a range of naturalistic design types. Phokaia retained an archaic look in its coinage right to the end of the series, employing 
simple designs (always with the civic badge of the seal included) along with the quadripartite incuse square long after it had been abandoned 
everywhere else. In the later series at Mytilene, the constant changing of types, usually of human form, whether mortal or god, led to elegant 
refinements in the depiction of the human form that are remarkable for their complex gem-like detail in a miniaturized format. The end of this 
long series came in 326 BC, when the entire coinage of the eastern Greek world was standardized after the coming of Alexander, and pure 
gold coinage came to be preferred over electrum.

Very rare. 
($75,000) 

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. The series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 10.6-10.7 grams, 
which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. Studies have shown that coins of both standards circulated together, but that the 
heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which continued to be used into the Persian period. 
The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and &apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting 
that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. The present coin, however, is from an issue 
that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage is here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Wiedauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The extreme rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was 
standardized. Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 
25), and, like Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

The reverse punches used on this example are the same ones used on the previous lot, a &quot;prototype&quot; issue of Kroisos that is regarded as the first 
gold coinage of the ancient world. As one would expect, the punches here appear to have been in a more worn state than when they were used 
for the prototype stater, confirming the relative chronology of the two issues, while also suggesting that there was not a significant distance 
in time between these issues, either.

One of Two Known 

245. 
CARIA, Knidos. Circa 200-150 BC. AR Tetradrachm (30mm, 16.61 g, 12h). Head of Apollo right, wearing laurel 
wreath / Artemis Hyakinthotrophos standing facing, head left, holding phiale in extended right hand, her left arm resting on 
the statue of an archaic deity with a sheathed body and wearing a polos; to lower left, forepart of stag standing left, upon 
which drips liquid from Artemis&apos; phiale; ˚@5d5o@ to right. G. Le Rider, &quot;Un tétradrachme hellénistique de Cnide&quot; in Essays 
Thompson, pp. 155-7 and pl. 18, 1 = BN inventory FRBNF41778907 (same dies). EF, lightly toned, some fine marks, slight 
doubling on reverse. Extremely rare, apparently the second known, the other in the BN. 
($30,000) 

The appearance of the head of Apollo on this extremely rare tetradrachm is not unusual, since that god was one of the principal deities of the 
area. As tutelary of Doris in Asia -a federation of six (later expanded to seven) Doric-founded cities in Karia -his sanctuary at Triopion near 
Knidos served as the federation&apos;s religious center. The reverse shows Artemis Hyakinthotrophos, whose cult was introduced into Knidos in 201 
BC following her epiphany there during the unsuccessful siege of that city by Philip V of Macedon (IG XII.4). The epithet Hyakinthotrophos 
(lit. nurse of Hyakinthos), used for Apollo, alludes to the myth of Hyakinthos, a Dorian youth and eromenos of Apollo, whom the god killed 
accidentally. The pre-Hellenic origin of the name Hykanthos, however, when taken in the context of the myth, may signify a Dorian divinity 
whose function was taken over by Apollo. The use of Hyakinthotrophos for Artemis, however, is unusual, since she appears nowhere in the 
traditional myth of Hyakinthos, although the goddess does appear briefly in a Spartan version. Given Apollo&apos;s importance to Knidos, the use 
of the epithet associates her with Apollo Hyakinthotrophos and places her on a par with the god as one of the chief protectors of the city. 
Imhoof-Blumer&apos;s argument (KM, p. 228, 3) that the archaïzed figure of Artemis on this issue was an allusion to the ancient Palladion of Troy, 
a view supported by the similar self-conscious archaïzing of the ethnic, suggests an attempt on the part of the Knidians to connect Artemis 
Hyakinthotrophos and her festival -the Hyakinthotrophia -with similar festivals in the region.

($1000) 

The Podalia and von Aulock pieces, struck from the same reverse die as the present coin, have the first letters of the dynast Trbbenimi inscribed 
on the obverse. Thus, it is likely that this is an example of a civic issue struck in Zemuri contemporary with the issues signed by Trbbenimi.

Significant Additions to the Corpus of Phaselis 

The following group of coins represent a remarkable addition to the corpus of the coinage of Phaselis. Most, if not all, appear to belong to 
Heipp-Tamer&apos;s 6th series, known to her from only two coins, each from a different issue by virtue of the variation in their control marks, 
which she dated to the 4th century BC. The types of the coins are consistently prow right on the obverse and stern left on the reverse, with 
varying markings in the fields on both sides as well as on the prow&apos;s fighting platform, likely denoting separate issues. In comparison to the 
similarly marked staters of the 3rd century that are marked with magistrates&apos; names (Heipp-Tamer Series 8, Emission 2), these staters are of 
more bold style both in type and epigraphy, with the exception of a few issues that have a monogram or no field markings. These latter issues 
have a more refined style, and longer ethnic; they appear to be the latest of these new issues, and might even be separated in time from the 
issues of bold style. 

If the varieties of control marks do, in fact, denote separate issues, we can add fourteen new issues to the two already identified by Heipp-
Tamer. Nearly all of the coins exhibit little, if any, die wear, suggesting numerous brief issues. Their relative chronology is unknown, as there 
do not appear to be any die links. That said, as mentioned above, the last four coins of this group below have a style that appears to be more like 
the 3rd century staters, which suggests that they are the latest in the group. The various symbols in the fields and on the fighting platform of the 
prow are usual types for Greek coins: cicadas, dolphins, gorgoneions, grapes, owls, serpents, shells, stars, and tripods, as well as Pegasos and 
Nike. The three issues with Nike and tripod, as well as an issue with a wreath affixed to a pole on the deck of the prow, stand out, suggesting 
some sort of a victory reference. Whether any such victory would be a military or games-related event is unknown, as much of the historic 
details of Phaselis during this period are obscure.

Exceptional Lycian Portraiture 

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the 
dynasts Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile 
portrait of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even 
see the portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, 
Mithrapata&apos;s successor, continue this trend, but also have two innovations that set them at the pinnacle of classical portraiture. First, the 
portrait is moved to the obverse of the coin, emphasizing the importance of the individual. Second, and most prominently, the portrait is not in 
the traditional profile, but in a dramatic facing state. Obviously influenced by Kimon&apos;s facing Arethusa-head coinage at Syracuse (see lot 55, 
above), these depict Perikles looking out from the surface of the coin with a serene countenance and his hair flowing around him as if blown 
by the wind. This depiction captures the essence of the earlier idealized portraits, conveying to the viewer a sense that Perikles was more 
than a mere man, but retaining the realism in its individualized features. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any 
sort of satrapal headgear, which was always included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence 
from the Persian king. These astonishing developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the 
region circa 360 BC.

VF, untouched dark brown patina. Extremely rare, the finest of six known, with clear legends and date. 
($30,000) 

Aristobulus&apos; wife, Salome, was the widow of Philip the Tetrarch and the daughter of Herodias by her first husband, Herod II (known in the 
New Testament as either Philip or Herod). Although she is unnamed in the Gospels, it has been traditionally assumed that it was Salome -at 
the insistence of her mother, Herodias -who asked Herod Antipas (who was besotted with his young step-daughter) for the head of John the 
Baptist in return for her risqué dance for the king. As a result, Salome has become a symbol for dangerous female seductiveness. 

The regnal date on this issue has been variously read as 3 (Γ), 8 (H), or 13 (IΓ). As noted in Hendin, p. 275, Frank Kovacs observed that most 
of the extant examples of this dual-portrait issue are poorly preserved, and the dates are usually illegible or only partially visible; only the year 
13 is clearly visible on any of them. Kovacs asserts that the coins reported as years 3 and 8 are likely misreadings of year 13, and the present 
coin with the clear date 13 confirms that view. The only other issue of Aristobulus with a clear date is a year 17 bronze with the titles of Titus 
on the reverse. Issues in years 13 and 17 by a client king of Rome would have a pro-Roman propaganda and political value, as those years 
correspond, respectively, to the beginning of the Jewish War and the destruction of the Temple.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson 
of Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalcis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of his rare coins name the 
emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius extended to 
him authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

From the Leonidion Collection. 

Shortly after his death in 281 BC, Seleukos I Soter, the founder of the Seleukid dynasty, was deified by his son and heir, Antiochos I. Almost 
immediately, Antiochos struck coins at a mint in Baktria bearing the portrait of his deceased father, to whose portrait was added a bull&apos;s horn. 
This feature recalled a famous incident while Soter served as a companion of Alexander the Great. In this event, Soter barehandedly subdued 
a bull that had been brought for sacrifice, after it had broke loose from its restraints. This horn became a standard feature of all Seleukos&apos; 
posthumous portraits. In 276 BC, Antiochos moved his residence from Baktria to Sardes, in order to deal with new threats arising in the West. 
Newell originally thought that the Seleukos portrait issues at Sardes began early in Antiochos&apos; reign, contemporary with the Baktrian issues. 
However, later studies have suggested that the Alexander type tetradrachms in the name of Antiochos began first, and the Seleukos portraits 
followed, likely beginning once Antiochos took residence there.

Seleukid oktadrachms were all ad-hoc issues, presumably produced for presentation purposes or as donatives. The present piece is no 
exception, as it was struck with an obverse die that was used to strike tetradrachms in an issue given to Uncertain Mint 68 in Mesopotamia 
in SC (cf. illustration of SC 1132.3b). The dating of the issue is based on the portrait style, which the authors of SC date circa 197-192/0 
BC. The appearance of this oktradrachm suggests that this mint may have been a place of some importance, but the historical circumstances 
are uncertain, as Antiochos was primarily involved in a conflict against the Ptolemies in Asia Minor. Perhaps this issue reflects some as yet 
unknown event to the east, as previously known issues of oktadrachms of Antiochos III have been linked to various military victories.

($200,000) 

From the David Hendin Collection, acquired in 1992 via an exchange with a European collector. 

The storied shekels of the fifth year of the Jewish War are by far the rarest and most storied; according to the Menorah Coin Project, this is the 
thirteenth known year 5 shekel struck from the classic die sets, three of them were found at Masada. This coin was struck by obverse die 1 / 
reverse die 6, the same dies from which one of the year 5 shekels found at Masada were struck, No. 3597. (Y. Meshorer, &quot;Coins of Masada&quot; 
in Masada I, The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963 -1965 Final Reports [Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1989].) 

Meshorer has written (TJC p. 130) that &quot;The amazing fact with regard to the coins of the fifth year is that they were struck then, in the last 
four months of the Jewish War against the Romans. At that time the striking of bronze coinage came to a complete halt. In those trying days, 
normal activities such as commerce and the consumption of goods no longer took place in Jerusalem, and there was thus no need to continue 
issuing these coins. On the other hand, silver shekels were still an important factor in the Holy City on account of their ritual value. Fulfillment 
of the precept of paying the half-shekel tribute to the Temple was all important, and the shekels continued to be minted even in the fifth year 
of the war.&quot;

Important Gamla Rebel Issue 

307. 
JUDAEA, Jewish War. 66-70 CE. AE (20mm, 7.62 g). Gamla mint. Struck circa 66-67 BC. Omer cup surrounded by 
crude paleo-Hebrew or Aramaic legend / Circular crude paleo-Hebrew or Aramaic legend. Meshorer 217; Kadman -; Hendin 
1372 (same dies as illustration); Bromberg 390 (same dies); Shoshana -; Sofaer -; Spaer -. Crude VF for type, desert patina. 
Very rare. 
($30,000) 

The excavations at Gamla yielded seven examples of this unusual coin. The Menorah Coin Project lists a total of nine examples from one 
obverse and two reverse dies. This coin was struck from reverse die 1. All of the coins are crudely made, reflecting the reality that Gamla 
had no skilled artisans to engrave or strike coins. Gamla lies in the central Golan Heights and was described by Josephus as a town that was 
a stronghold of Jews early in the Jewish War, but Romans, led by Vespasian and Titus, conquered Gamla on October 20, 67 AD. The Gamla 
coin was obviously inspired by the Jewish War silver shekels of Jerusalem; however, the crudeness of the inscriptions make them difficult to 
read. Meshorer (TJC p. 131) first read the inscription as &quot;for the redemption of&quot; on the obverse and &quot;holy Jerusalem&quot; on the reverse. Farhi (in 
INJ 15) later read the obverse as &quot;Gamla [year] 2.&quot; 

According to Yoav Arbel, &quot;[t]he benefits of this modest coin surpass its local significance, [it] is possibly the only item that offers us a glimpse 
into the ideology that guided a provincial rebel authority far from the provisional government in Jerusalem (which would probably have 
disapproved of its minting if asked.&quot; (&quot;The Gamla Coin: A New Perspective on the Circumstances and Date of its Minting,&quot; in D. Miano and

Johnston has interpreted this remarkable reverse design as a relief map of the hinterland of Ephesos, which would make it the earliest Greek 
map and first physical relief map known. On the right (north) are the mountains Tmolos and Messogis between the river valleys of the Caÿster 
and Maeander, to the left of which are three mountain ridges (Madranbaba Dagi, Karincali Dagi, and Akaba Tepesi). Johnston follows Six in 
suggesting that the coins were probably struck under the Persian general Memnon at Ephesos, circa 336-334 BC, in order to pay his army after 
he had captured the city, but before his defeat by Alexander at the Battle of Granicus in 334. However, Johnston&apos;s theory has been the subject 
of some doubt, most notably by Leo Mildenberg.

Cleopatra Selene, along with her brothers Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphos, were brought to Rome following Octavian&apos;s victory 
at Actium. Cleopatra&apos;s hand was given to Juba II, Augustus&apos; loyal client king, sometime between 26 and 20 BC. The date of her death is a 
matter of debate, possibly occurring sometime around AD 4 or as late as 17. Her brothers presumably died in childhood, either naturally or 
by assassination.

This type was the first anywhere to feature the portrait of Julius Caesar. C. Vibius Pansa was part of the Caesarian faction at Rome and 
probably owed his proconsulship to his patron. The only other definite lifetime portrait of Caesar from the provincial series was an issue of 
circa 45 BC at Lampsacus (RPC I 2268-2269). Both of these issues preceded the earliest appearance of his portrait at Rome, on the denarii 
of M. Mettius in January, in 44 BC.

Spoerri Butcher (RPC VII.1) recorded only two specimens for Furius Themisonos, as well as a unique specimen of the same type and from 
the same obverse die but signed by the archon K. Phanias Themisonos. This is perhaps the third known for this variant and the only in private 
hands. 

The obverse die used for this issue was also used to strike medallions for Germe in Lydia.

Ex Gemini II (10 January 2006), lot 495. 

Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, fell in love with the Athenian hero Theseus and helped him defeat the Minotaur and free the 
Athenian captives from the Labyrinth. She then fled with him from Crete. Upon stopping at Naxos, Theseus abandoned Ariadne while she was 
sleeping and returned to Athens alone. Ariadne was discovered by Dionysus, who made her his wife. Most versions of the tale paint Theseus as 
a cad, but according to one version Dionysus forced Theseus to desert her because they had profaned his sacred grotto at Naxos. In any case, 
Ariadne joined the ranks of the divine, bearing many children by Dionysus, and her wedding diadem became the Corona Borealis. Pergamum, 
with its strong links to Dionysiac cult, celebrates the god&apos;s human consort on this impressive medallion.

This medallion is part of a highly interesting series that has long fascinated numismatists. Taken as a whole, the group chronicles the major 
events of Caracalla&apos;s visit to Pergamum en route to an eastern military expedition in AD 214. While this was only one stop on a trip that 
included imperial visits to the major cities and religious sites of Asia Minor, Pergamum&apos;s sanctuary of Asclepius (the Asclepion) was of 
particular appeal to Caracalla, whose health declined precipitously in the latter years of his reign.

Ex Triton XVI (8 January 2013), lot 706. 

This medallion, part of a series struck on behalf of Caracalla (see CNG 81, lot 792), commemorates the renewal of the city&apos;s neocorate, first 
instituted under Commodus between AD 185 and 189. The neocorate was a position bestowed by the Senate to certain worthy cities of Asia 
Minor to establish and maintain the imperial cult there. The honor and prestige of this distinction was of great benefit to the city involved and 
created a reciprocal association between Rome and important provincial urban centers. A series of coins related to this renewal are dated CY 
88 (see CNG Inv. 733744). Basing this era on the visit of the emperor Hadrian in AD 129, the coins would have been issued during Caracalla&apos;s 
trek through Asia Minor during his march East against the Parthians. The three medallions (Burrell coin types 7, 8, and 9), struck under the 
authority of Pigres, are specific in their reverse designs, indicating the imperial presence in the city at the time.

The father of Philip I, Julius Marinus hailed from a small town in the province of Arabia (modern day Shuhba, Syria; the original name of the 
ancient town is unknown). Following the death of Marinus, Philip deified his father and had a temple to him built in his newly aggrandized 
hometown -now renamed Philippopolis and elevated to the rank of colonia. 

The neat fabric of the city&apos;s coins is quite out of place for Arabia. This, combined with die links between the coins of Philippopolis, Zeugma, 
and Antioch, point to production at a central location, with Antioch being the likeliest candidate.

Three Zodiac Drachms 

Alexandria saw an immense output of coinage during the eighth year of Antoninus Pius&apos;s reign. The Zodiac drachms, mythological types, 
and a host of issues for the nomes appeared that year. One explanation for this activity centers on the celebration of the renewal of the Great 
Sothic cycle, the point when the star Sothis (Sirius) rises on the same point on the horizon as the sun. This cycle of 1461 years began early 
in the reign of Pius in AD 139, and apparently prompted a renewal in the ancient Egyptian religion, while the coin types also stressed the 
connections to the Greco-Roman Pantheon.

The revolt of Rome&apos;s Italian allies (socii, hence &apos;Social War&apos;) broke out toward the close of the year 91 BC and was the culmination 
of longstanding grievances occasioned by the Senate&apos;s inept handling of foreign relations. The Marsi were especially prominent in this 
movement, hence the name &apos;Marsic Confederation,&apos; which is often applied to the rebel state. The main fighting was in the years 90-89 BC 
and the rebellion assumed alarming proportions when both consuls for 90 BC were defeated by rebel armies. Rome appeared to be in serious 
danger of defeat, but the movement collapsed as suddenly as it had begun. The victory was achieved largely through the political concession of 
granting Roman citizenship to the enemy. Thereafter, all of Italy south of the Po was united by this common bond. The coinage of the Marsic 
Confederation is of great interest, consisting principally of silver denarii, some of which bear the names of the rebel generals. The reverse here 
depicts the raging Italian bull trampling and goring the Roman wolf.

($1500) 

A temple to Juno Moneta (an epithet perhaps meaning &quot;the advisor&quot;) was dedicated on the Capitoline Hill in 344 BC, and the manufacture of 
coinage at that spot led to the adoption of Juno&apos;s epithet to refer to &quot;mints&quot; and &quot;money.&quot;

Traditional Iron Ring 

403. 
Imperatorial Period. Circa 41 BC. FE ring with jasper intaglio. Solid iron ring with flat bezel inset with oval jasper 
intaglio of a bare male head (Octavian [?]) left. Dimensions: 30mm overall length; 19mm overall width; 22mm overall height; 
12.51 g overall weight. Dimension of intaglio: 12x15mm. Cf. Crawford 513/2-3 (denarius; for portrait). As made, complete, 
iron completely oxidized, but stable. 
($10,000) 

While the portrait on the intaglio of this ring is similar to a denarius issue of M. Arrius Secundus (see previous lot), it is unlikely that the image 
is of Secundus himself. Like the portrait issues of his contemporaries, Numonius Vaala and Servius Rufus, which featured living and deceased 
political figures, the Secundus portrait bears a more than passing similarity to Octavian.

($750,000) 

This issue is among the many late Republican coins that have direct connections to historical events. It is thought to have been struck in the 
late summer or autumn of 42 BCE at a military mint travelling with Brutus and Cassius in western Asia Minor or northern Greece. True to 
his Republican ideals, Brutus eschewed the use of his own portrait when he began coining jointly with Cassius early in 42 BC, but in the 
final months before Philippi he adopted the method of his adversaries, and placed his own portrait on his coins. The goal, no doubt, was to 
encourage personal loyalty --to rally support behind Brutus as the descendant of the very founder of the Republic --as the decisive battle 
against the combined force of Antony and Octavian approached. The trophy on the reverse combines elements of land and sea victories, and 
is thought to celebrate the military victories of Brutus in Lycia and Thrace, along with the heroic naval feats of Cassius in resistance to the 
Rhodians. The tiny L on the reverse may represent either Libertas, a primary ideal of the tyrannicides, or Lycia, where Brutus had a military 
victory, but there is little evidence beyond speculation. Publius Servilius Casca Longus, the moneyer, was one of the Senatorial conspirators 
against Julius Caesar, and was among those who plunged their daggers into the dictator on the Ides of March in 44 BCE. 

This brief issue, known from a total of 17 coins, was produced from two obverse dies and four reverse dies (it is likely that the Vatican piece 
was struck with either reverse die c or d). Obverse die (A) is known from just three examples. Reverse die (a) was originally engraved without 
the L (noted as a1 below), but was soon modified by the addition of the L (noted as a2 below), which appears on all three subsequent reverse 
dies. This suggests that the L has special significance, and its omission at the beginning may have been a mistake of the engraver. Reverse die 
(a) was then replaced with reverse die (b), first paired with obverse die (A), and then also obverse die (B). On all known examples, obverse die 
(A) exhibits practically no die wear. Nevertheless, judging from the lack of wear on reverse die (b) on all the examples in which it was paired 
with obverse die (B), it is apparent that obverse die (A) was retired after a short life. A possible explanation could be that both obverse dies 
were used in parallel, and that reverse die (b) was used for both, but the lack of further reverse dies paired with obverse die (A) suggests that 
this was not the case; that the obverse dies were used sequentially. In any event, obverse die (B) was then used with both subsequent reverse 
dies, (c) and (d), and exhibits gradual die wear throughout, which allows the sequence to be revealed. The complete corpus is as follows:

($100,000) 

Marcus Junius Brutus was the son of Marcus Junius Brutus and Julius Caesar&apos;s former mistress, Servilia. By 59 BC, he acquired the alternative 
name Quintus Caepio Brutus through adoption by his uncle, Quintus Servilius Caepio. Brought up by Porcius Cato, he was educated in 
philosophy and oratory and long retained a fierce hatred of his natural father&apos;s murderer, Pompey. He began his political career in 58 BC by 
accompanying Cato to Cyprus. As triumvir monetalis in about 54 BC, he issued coins illustrating his strong republican views with Libertas 
and portraits of his ancestors L. Junius Brutus (who overthrew Tarquinius Superbus, the last Etruscan king of Rome) and Servilius Ahala (the 
later fifth century BC tyrannicide) (Crawford 433/1 and 2, respectively). In 53 BC, Brutus served in Cilicia as quaestor to Appius Claudius 
Pulcher, whose successor, Cicero, found that &apos;the honourable Brutus&apos; was extracting 48 per cent interest on a loan to the city of Salamis in 
Cyprus, contrary to the lex Gabinia. 

Brutus, the principled student, stoic, and Platonist who wrote a number of philosophical treatises and poems, seems an unlikely tyrannicide, 
quite dissimilar to the vehement Cassius. Despite his hatred of Pompey, he followed him in the Civil War of 49 BC against Caesar, but after the 
former&apos;s defeat at Pharsalus he sought and was granted Caesar&apos;s pardon. He proceeded to enjoy Caesar&apos;s favor and was appointed governor 
of Gaul in 46 BC, praetor in 44 BC and consul designate for 41 BC. Perhaps under the influence of his second wife Porcia, Cato&apos;s daughter, 
Brutus joined the conspiracy against Caesar, becoming the leader alongside Cassius. The reaction of the populace in the aftermath of the Ides 
of March compelled Brutus to leave Rome in April 44 BC. 

The Senate&apos;s resolution to declare him a &apos;public enemy&apos; on 28 November 44 BC was soon repealed and in February 43 BC, he was appointed 
governor of Crete, the Balkan provinces, and later Asia. Suspecting the intentions of Antony and Octavian, Brutus went to Macedonia and won 
the loyalty of its governor, Hortensius, and there levied an army and seized much of the funds prepared by Caesar for his Parthian expedition. 
Successful against the Bessi in Thrace, he was hailed imperator by his troops, but after the establishment of the triumvirate in November 
43 BC he was outlawed again and joined forces with Cassius at Sardes. In the summer of 42 BC, they marched through Macedonia and in 
October met Octavian on the Via Egnatia just outside Philippi and won the first battle. Cassius, as his conservative coins show, remained true 
to the old republican cause, while Brutus followed the self-advertising line of Antony in the new age of unashamed political propaganda and 
struck coins displaying his own portrait. Brutus&apos; estrangement from Cassius was effectively complete when this remarkably assertive coin was 
struck extolling the pileus or cap of liberty (symbol of the Dioscuri, saviors of Rome, and traditionally given to slaves who had received their 
freedom) between the daggers that executed Caesar. In the ironic twist of fate, Brutus committed suicide during the second battle at Philippi 
on 23 October 42 BC, using the dagger with which he assassinated Caesar. 

This extraordinary type is one of the few specific coin issues mentioned by a classical author, Dio Cassius, Roman History 47. 25, 3: &quot;Brutus 
stamped upon the coins which were being minted his own likeness and a cap and two daggers, indicating by this and by the inscription that he 
and Cassius had liberated the fatherland.&quot; The only securely identified portraits of Brutus occur on coins inscribed with his name; all others, 
whether on coins or other artifacts, are identified based on the three issues inscribed BRVTVS IMP (on aurei) or BRVT IMP (on denarii). A 
careful study of Brutus&apos; portraits by S. Nodelman segregates these inscribed portraits into three main categories: a &apos;baroque&apos; style portrait on 
the aurei of Casca, a &apos;neoclassical&apos; style on the aurei of Costa, and a &apos;realistic&apos; style on the &apos;EID MAR&apos; denarii, which Nodelman describes as 
&quot;the soberest and most precise&quot; of all.

This coin was part of an issue that was struck to commemorate the reconciliation pact between Antony and Octavian made at Brundisium in 
October 40 BC. In the years following the Battle of Philipi in 42 BC, Antony and Octavian withdrew to their respective spheres of influence; 
Antony in the east and Octavian the west. The separation put stress on the relationship between them, as well as between their supporters. This 
stress built into open conflict between Octavian and Antony&apos;s brother, Lucius, and wife, Fulvia in the Perusine War. Octavian quickly defeated 
his opponents, and it seemed as though all out war between Antony and Octavian was imminent, but the untimely death of Lucius and Fulvia, 
amazingly due to natural causes, allowed the conflict to quell. This interlude led to a meeting between the two leaders, who pledged peace, 
with Antony sealing the pact by marrying Octavian&apos;s sister, Octavia.

The reverse of this denarius depicts a Roman naval and military trophy. Known in Latin as a tropaeum from the Greek τρόπαιον, it typically 
consisted of the helmet, cuirass, and shields of a defeated enemy arranged on a tree trunk with arm-like branches. Arranged around its base 
were additional arms and sometimes bound captives. Here, in place of the additional arms and/or captives the trophy sits on the beak (rostrum) 
of an enemy warship with a rudder and anchor at its base. 

This denarius was part of a series of aurei and denarii that were struck between the autumn of 30 BC and 29 BC and which conveyed a general 
message of victory and refoundation. Sear associated this denarius with a contemporary aureus showing on its reverse a similar trophy housed 
in a tetrastyle temple decorated with a triskeles in its pediment. The obverse of that coin, a bust of Diana Siciliensis, led him to argue that the 
aureus commemorated Octavian&apos;s important victory over Sextus Pompey at the Battle of Naulochus in 36 BC. The reverse of this denarius, 
however, is more ambiguous, by leaving the specific victory unspecified. The most likely possibility is that it commemorates Agrippa&apos;s victory 
over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium the previous September, the final triumph for Octavian, the undisputed master of the Roman Empire.

The A.K. Collection of Roman Coinage 

The A.K. Collection of the coins of the Roman Empire was carefully assembled over several decades with a great deal of thought and 
commitment. The present selection consists of 423 bronze and silver pieces from the reigns of Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, 
Faustina Senior, Faustina Junior and Lucilla, and includes both Provincial and Imperial issues. The coins have been divided into the following 
14 lots: four lots only contain denarii; seven lots that only contain bronze coins; one lot of Provincial bronzes; and two lots of Alexandrian 
coins. 

The quality of the coins ranges from Fine to Extremely-fine. This interesting collection includes some very rare coins as well as pieces from 
important collections like those of von Aulock, Dattari, Levis, Nägeli, Steger, Stöcklin, and Voirol. Most of the coins are provenanced from 
auctions or lists or were bought directly from stock such as those of E. Beckenbauer, Munich; H. Blaser-Frey, Freiburg; E. Bourgey, Paris; 
Ernst-Algie, Stuttgart; J. Florange, Paris; Frankfurter Münzhandlung E. Button, Frankfurt; Hauck &amp; Aufhäuser, Munich; G. Hirsch, Munich;

This denarius type is usually attributed to Colonia Patricia (modern Cordoba) in Spain. The obverse depicts the elaborate regalia (ornamenta 
triumphalia) of a successful general that is awarded to him on the occasion of his procession through the streets of Rome as triumphator. The 
toga picta was an elaborate dress based on the attire of the Etruscan kings and is shown being worn over the tunica palmata, a tunic decorated 
with representations of palm leaves. On either side are seen a legionary eagle, symbolic of the Roman army, and a triumphal wreath, or corona 
triumphalis. This was worn by the triumphator as he paraded through the streets of the capital in the elaborately adorned chariot, which is 
depicted on the reverse. 

In 19 BC, Augustus returned to Rome after a three-year absence in Greece and Asia, and this reverse type probably relates to the celebration 
of the military successes of this period, especially Tiberius&apos; activities in Armenia and the restoration of the standards that the Parthians had 
captured from Crassus in 53 BC.

Nerva assumed power in AD 96, continuing use of only one of Domitian&apos;s coin reverse types; namely, that of Fortuna. Nerva changed the 
reverse legend from FORTVNA AVGVSTI to FORTVNA AVGVST. This example is intriguing, because it seems to have been struck from an 
actual reverse die for Domitian, changed to a die of Nerva by removing much of the final letter of the legend.

be the same as Gnecchi pl. 145, 5. The NFA catalog notes: Of this type, Harold Mattingly writes in the Introduction to the British Museum 
Catalogue (p. clxix), &quot;The oak-wreath dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus may be connected with the bestowal of the title of &quot;P P&quot; on 
Hadrian. &quot;To the Greek world Hadrian appeared as a Zeus Olympios...The dediction may be one of thankfulness to the god who, for the 
blessing of Rome, had bestowed his sceptre on Hadrian.&quot;

Hadrian&apos;s extended imperial tour of the provinces lasted for a large portion of his years as emperor. In order to take stock of his inheritance as 
well as calm the disquiet which had arisen in the later years of Trajan&apos;s reign, the new emperor traveled throughout the provinces, reestablishing 
the Roman order, and reconnecting with local governments, ultimately ensuring the Pax Romana for another half-century.

This very rare and important aureus is one of only four recorded gold types in the extensive &apos;legionary&apos; series issued by Severus at the 
very outset of his reign. According to Dio Cassius (XLVI, 46, 7), he paid an accession donative of 250 denarii (ten aurei) per man and in all 
likelihood the legionary coinage was specially struck for this purpose. Legio XIV Gemina Martia Victrix received special honors from the new 
emperor as he had been the commander of this unit at the time of his elevation to imperial status. Originally formed by Octavian, this legion 
had participated in the invasion and conquest of Britain under Claudius and had gained its additional epithet of Martia Victrix for the vital role 
that it played in the defeat of the Icenian revolt led by Boudicca in 60 AD

The reverse of this medallion depicts the tres Monetae, female personifications of the three metals of gold, silver, and bronze, and 
commemorates the attempt of Claudius II to reform Roman currency. When Claudius II took the throne on the death of Gallienus in AD 268 
AD, the Roman Empire had reached a low point. In addition to the numerous internal and external rebellions, the economy was in a state of 
near-collapse. While gold aurei still continued to be struck in order to pay the army, silver denarii and antoniniani, as well as the earlier large 
bronze denominations, had disappeared completely. In their place, near-billon antoniniani had become the medium of daily exchange. These 
too, however, were being reduced in size and silver content. Claudius II seems to have planned a reform of the currency, and he also began 
minting a wide variety of reverse types which emphasized traditional divine protection and renewal of Roman power. Unfortunately, the early 
death of Claudius delayed the anticipated monetary reformation, which his successor, Aurelian, would carry through.

($50,000) 

Probus spent the first several years of his reign fighting off invaders from the north and east, and suppressing internal revolts from several of 
his field commanders. The most pressing concern at the time of Probus&apos; accession was the invasions of the Franks in the north and Germanic 
tribes (including the Vandals and Burgundians) in the center and south. It took Probus two years (277-278) to defeat these tribes and restore 
the Roman frontier on the Rhine and Upper Danube. In 279, he turned his attention eastward, defeating the Getae on the Lower Danube, and 
then crossed into Asia Minor to suppress a band of robbers led by Lydius the Isaurian. Next came the suppression of a revolt in upper Egypt 
led by a Nubian tribe, the Blemmyae. Lastly, came the revolts of Bonosus, Proculus, and Saturninus, each of whom either died in battle or 
was betrayed by his troops. Finally, in 281 Probus returned to Rome to celebrate his many victories with a triumph held toward the end of the 
year. Accompanying this triumph were lavish games and gladiatorial contests, as well as a large donative. This aureus, celebrating the &quot;Always 
Victorius&quot; Probus, was part of that donative.

The higher-than-average weight for this coin, a weight that harkens back to the reign of Diocletian, suggests that this coin was part of a 
festaureus issue -coinage struck for a special celebration. Likewise, the reverse, showing Sol Invictus, is also unusual. While Sol Invictus 
was a particularly common type on Roman coinage, especially during the third quarter of the third century, his use as a type began to fall 
out of favor following Constantine&apos;s victory over Maxentius in AD 312 at the Milvian Bridge. Also, the depiction of Sol in Oriental attire is 
relatively rare in Roman coin iconography, and may be indicative of the purpose for this issue. Sol&apos;s appearance in form on a very rare issue 
of aurei of Galerius as Caesar from Alexandria certainly refers to that emperor&apos;s war against the Sasanians in AD 298, while later issues of 
Maximinus at Antioch and Alexandria have been associated with his persecution of the Christians. As there was peace between the Romans 
and Persians at the time of the present issue, its striking at Nicomedia, a mint held by Licinius, may allude to the resurgence of persecutions 
against Christians in his eastern territories in the years following his uneasy rapprochment with Constantine at Campus Ardiensis in AD 317.

Following the assassination of Valentinian III in AD 455, Petronius Maximus seized the throne and immediately married Valentinian&apos;s wife, 
Licinia Eudoxia. Licinia, believing that Petronius was responsible for her late husband&apos;s death, was not happy with the new arrangement, and 
she appealed to the Vandal king of Carthage, Gaiseric, for help. Gaiseric responded to Licinia&apos;s plea and quickly sailed for Italy. Fearing for 
his life, Petronius decided to flee, but was abandoned by his bodyguard. While riding out of Rome on 31 May, he was stoned and killed. His 
reign lasted for only seventy days.

The enthroned Constantinopolis type of Anastasius was struck in three denominations (follis, half follis, and decanummium), all of which 
are extremely rare today. Discussing this issue in relation to Anastasius&apos; copper currency reform, Hahn (MIBE p. 29) notes: &quot;[a]t first the 
doubling of the weight standard in 512 was accompanied by some uncertainty whether to make the flans broader or thicker in order to meet 
the new standard. An exceptional issue struck on thick flans shows a figural representation of the seated Constantinopolis on the rev. flanked 
by the value mark to the left and star as privy mark to the right. It is represented by only one or two specimens for each denomination so that 
it has been supposed to be an extraordinary although full issue. Apart from the Tyche on Antioch pentanummia this is the only pictorial design 
on reformed copper coins. There is no obvious occasion (such as a secular anniversary of Constantinopole) with which the issue might be 
connected; its explanation as a first, experimental issue on the heavy standard therefore seems more likely.&quot;

Struck during the Sasanian siege of Jerusalem, which lasted from April-May of 614. Two follis variants were issued, one with the ethnic in 
exergue and one with XCNIKA. A developing flaw on an obverse die used for both variants indicates that the folles with ethnic were issued 
first, those with &quot;Christ conquers&quot; apparently struck as the situation became increasingly desperate (Bendall p. 313). Interestingly, although 
struck four years into Heraclius&apos; reign, these folles still copy the portrait of Phocas.

Little is known about Theodosius III. He was a tax-gatherer from Adramytium who reluctantly accepted the purple when the troops in 
Opsikion revolting against Anastasius II. He appears to have had little appetite for governing and abdicated in 717 to become a monk. He has 
been identified with the bishop &quot;Theodosius of Ephesus, son of Apsimar,&quot; who was spiritual advisor to Leo III in the 720s and presided over 
Constantine V&apos;s Iconoclastic Council in 754. 

Only one other Rome mint solidus of Theodoisus is in CoinArchives (CNG 61 [25 Septemnber 2002], lot 2176), which hammered at $8250.

($750) 

Eudocia ruled as regent from the death of her husband Constantine X in May of 1067 until the end of the year. At the time, the empire was 
facing a military crisis in the east as the Seljuq Turks advanced further into Asia Minor, and the prevailing feeling was that a competent 
military leader should be emperor. Eudocia, despite having declared that she would never remarry, took the hand of Romanus IV Diogenes 
on 1 January 1068. Romanus&apos; own rule lasted a little over two and a half years, as he was captured by the Turks at the Battle of Mantzikert in 
August of 1071. Eudocia was re-established as regent for two months before being coerced into retiring to a convent. Whether this issue dates 
to her first or second term as regent has been debated, but the former seems more logical. While by no means abundant, the output of this 
coinage seems too large to be condensed into the short span of her second regency.

While the cataloger has been unable to link the obverse die to a recorded issue of Heraclius from the Ravenna mint, the stylistic similarities 
of our coin to the solidi and folles of Heraclius from that mint suggests that they provided the model for the obverse. It would not be unusual 
to find such inspiration in a southern Italian mint, since these coins circulated widely throughout the Italian peninsula while it remained under 
the control of the Exarchate of Ravenna (circa AD 540-751), which had been the center of Byzantine power in Italy, and the type would have 
been recognizable as currency. The reverse can be die-linked to a Southern Italian issue of Theophilus, provisionally assigned to Naples for 
stylistic and logistical reasons by Grierson (DOC III, pp. 85-7). Based on this, our coin must also have a Southern Italian origin, possibly 
the Naples mint, as well. The earlier reverse die state of our coin, when compared with the one illustrated in the Dumbarton Oaks catalog, 
as well as the large die break on the obverse of our coin, suggests that our coin is possibly a contemporary issue, or, more likely, a preceding 
issue from the same mint. That it may have been Naples is based on Grierson&apos;s assumption that the Southern Italian issues of Theophilus 
may have been minted there. According to him, the style and fabric of the Southern Italian coins of Theophilus suggested a connection with 
the Dukes of Beneventum and a mint within their vicinity. When the striking of gold coinage ceased under Grimoald IV (806-817) and could 
not be resumed until into the reign of Sico (819-832), a nearby mint had to step in. The only logical nearby mint, in his opinion, that could 
do this was the old Byzantine mint of Naples, which had been closed by the reign of Leo III (AD 717-741), but which still had the resources 
available to do so. Given the need to strike gold coinage during the social and political upheavals of this turbulent period, any available mint 
had to be employed.

Iconic Rarity of the Umayyad Caliphate

dīn al-haqq lī-yuzhirahu &apos;ala al-dīn kollihi walau kariha al-mushrikūn (Muhammad id the messenger of Allah; him He sent 
with guidance and true faith to make it prevail over all other faiths even though the polytheists may hate it) / The &quot;Umayyad 
Symbol&quot; (Sura 112 [al-ikhlas]) Āllah ahad Āllah āl-samad lam yalīd wa lam yalūd (Allah [is] One; Allah [is] the Eternal,

($200,000) 

This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a superb example of the Umayyad dinar struck in the year 77 of the Hijra. This iconic coin was 
the first of its kind to describe the tenets of the Islamic Faith rather than being issued on behalf of a political dynasty. It exercised an influence 
far beyond the borders of the Islamic Empire for over a thousand years. It drew a clear line between the coinage of the former rulers of the 
Levant, who were the Trinitarian Byzantines, and the monophysite Arabs. Its texts perfectly encapsulated the new Faith of Islam. The obverse 
field states the unique nature of God, and in the margin that Muhammad, as the messenger of God, was responsible for the spread of this belief. 
The field legend on the reverse expands on this by ruling out the incarnation of Christ as the Son of God. The margin emphasizes that the 
coin was struck in the name of God, rather than the Umayyad ruler, and shows the date of its striking in the new Hijra era. Thus, the legends 
encapsulated a vigorous response to the Byzantine gold solidus of Justinian II where an image of Christ was placed on the obverse and that 
of the Emperor grasping a cross on the reverse. 

History does not record the exact date at which the Caliph &apos;Abd al-Malik bin Marwan introduced his new coinage, but because of the rarity of 
this issue the cataloguer suggests that it was probably toward the end of the year 77, perhaps for the pilgrimage season at the time of the &apos;Eid 
al-Adha. All those who held examples of this coin in their hands, and the annual issues which followed after it, carried with them a powerful 
missionary document which explained all that was necessary for a follower of the Faith to accept. In an age before modern communications, 
coinage was the most effective messenger that the government possessed to sway the hearts and minds of the people under its rule. 

CNG wishes to thank Robert Darley-Doran for his assistance in drafting the description and background note for this lot.

During the late Napoleonic era, Zara (modern-day Zadar in Croatia) was part of the Illyrian Provinces, a group of states located between 
Austria and the Adriatic Sea. In the early 1800s, the area was held by Austria, which was embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars. After its defeat 
at the Battle of Wagram, Austria ceded the territory to France in the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn. In an attempt to take back its lost territory, 
in 1813 Austria declared war on France. When the Austrian General Franz Tomassich entered the Illyrian Provinces, many Croatian soldiers 
abandoned their French commanders and joined him. After a 34-day siege, the Austrians succeeded in capturing Zara from the French on 6 
December 1813. This piece was produced by the French garrison that held the town during the siege. A similar example, appearing in Gorny

On the border between the Mughal Empire and Safavid Iran, the city of Balkh periodically changed hands as both powers fought for control 
of Central Asia. Ironically, it was the Safavid shah Tahmasp I who helped the Mughal emperor Humayun recover his kingdom after he had 
been overthrown by Sher Shah Suri. The Mughals since that time only intermittently controlled Balkh and other Central Asian cities since 
they focused on their more successful conquest of India. Shah Jahan briefly reconquered Balkh, controlling it from 1641 to 1647, when the 
city was finally lost to the Safavids. In their final year of holding the city, the Mughals issued extremely rare gold Mohurs, of which this is an 
example. This short period represents the only issuance of Indian-type coinage by the Mughal Empire in Central Asia.

In the Dutch Eighty Years&apos; War (1568-1648), Amsterdam initially refused to join Holland, Zeeland, and the southern provinces, which wanted 
to push the Spanish from Dutch territory. In late 1577, the rebel Dutch forces blockaded the city. The blockade ended in February of 1578, 
when Amsterdam grudgingly agreed to join the rebellion against Spain. Soon after, the Catholic town council was replaced by Protestant 
members loyal to William, Prince of Orange, thus positioning Amsterdam as a participant in the Dutch struggle for independence. During the 
blockade, the city struck several denominations of silver siege coinage.

In the early Republic, each of the Mexican states had the right to establish and derive income from a mint. The State of Mexico, not wanting 
to miss out on the profits afforded to the other states, established their mint at Tlalpan, a mere ten miles from the federal mint at Mexico City. 
Unfortunately, the establishment was not profitable, and operated at a loss from 1828 until its closing in 1830.

($1000) 

Following the death of Mircea the Elder in 1418, control of Wallachia fell to Mircea&apos;s nephew, Mihail I, a member of the Danesti branch of the 
Basarab family. Mircea&apos;s illegitimate son Vlad was living at the time at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund. Vlad was surnamed 
Dracul, or Dragon, so-called because of his membership in the Ordo Draconis, or Order of the Dragon, a secret knighthood instituted by the 
Holy Roman Emperor to fight the Ottoman Empire. The symbol of the order was that of a dragon. 

Unable to succeed to the Wallachian throne because of his illegtimacy, in 1431 Sigismund appointed him governor of Transylvania. That same 
year his son, Vlad, was born. Though this boy would later acquire the epithet Tepes, or Impaler, because of his preferred method of torture, he 
is better known by his nickname Dracula, or &quot;son of the dragon,&quot; which became the inspiration for Bram Stoker&apos;s immortal vampire, Count 
Dracula. Discontent with being governor of Transylvania, Dracul was eager to claim the Wallachian throne for himself. After killing Mihail 
I, he became voivode of Wallachia in 1436, but his position was far from secure. He was a vassal of Hungary by oath, but also a tributary of 
the Ottomans as voivode. When the Turks invaded Transylvania in 1442, the Hungarian king accused his vassal of failing to properly defend 
the southern approaches to Transylvania, and forced Vlad out of Wallachia. In the meantime, the Hungarian general Janos Hunyadi installed 
another ruler in Vlad&apos;s absence. Vlad appealed to the Sultan for aid, which was granted, and Vlad regained the throne the following year. In 
return for the Ottoman aid, Vlad&apos;s younger sons, Vlad Dracula and Radu, were sent to the Sultan&apos;s court as hostages. Hostilities soon arose 
again between Hungary and the Ottomans, and Vlad was summoned to join the Hungarian side as a member of the Ordo Draconis. So as not 
to enrage the Turks and endanger his younger sons, Vlad sent his eldest son Mircea in his stead. The crusade failed and Vlad fell further out 
of favor with Hungary, which arranged his murder in 1447. 

The existence of Vlad II Dracul&apos;s coinage is known from a commercial charter dated to 1437, in which Vlad granted customs privilege to the 
merchants of Brasov. The charter mentions that both ducats and bani were struck by him. These coins were first published at the beginning 
of the 20th century, and the most recent paper dealing with the coinage of Vlad II Dracul recorded only seven specimens of this issue: six in 
public collections in Romania, and the seventh in the Fitzwilliam Museum (K. Parvan, &quot;Cateva consideratii privind activitatea monetara a lui 
Vlad Dracul -Considerations Regarding the Coin Minting Activity of Vlad II Dracul,&quot; Studii si Cercetari de Numismatica X [1993], p.101-7). 
Other than these few in public collections, only a handful have appeared on the market.

A global military conflict between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years&apos; War (known in North America as the French and Indian War) involved 
most of the great powers of the time, and affected Europe, Central America, the western coast of Africa, India, the Philippines, and the 
aforementioned colonial America. 

In North America, specifically, the conflict centered around the expulsion of Great Britain&apos;s Bourbon rivals in the contested overseas territories, 
whereupon she gained a great deal of New France, Spanish Florida, and some of the Caribbean islands. The ensuing battles focused upon the 
borders separating these territories, especially with New France. The name for the conflict emanates from the two major British adversaries in 
this theater: France and the Native American tribes within the region, who joined with the French. The outcome in North America resulted in 
lands gains by the British, which confirmed Britain&apos;s position as the dominant colonial power in the eastern half of the continent.

The Dr. Andrew Wayne Collection of Anglo-Saxon Coins 
Part One 

Classical Numismatic Group is delighted to offer part one of the Dr. Andrew Wayne collection of Anglo-Saxon 
coins for auction. 

Originally a scientist involved in leukemia research including pioneering bone marrow transplants for acute 
leukemia, Dr. Wayne is now a seasoned business technology consultant. He runs his own consultancy specializing 
in change, project and programme management in London. 

Dr. Wayne started collecting coins in the 1970s but seriously took up the pursuit in 1995. Initially, he collected 
across a broad range: from Celtic to Roman through the English hammered series, and also milled silver coins. 
He increasingly became focused on the Anglo-Saxon series as it represented &apos;the most diverse and interesting 
range of coin types in the English series&apos;. Consequently, other areas of his collection were disposed of: Classical 
Numismatic Group sold Dr. Wayne&apos;s English hammered coins in 2006 and his Norman coins in 2011. 

Dr. Wayne&apos;s Anglo-Saxon collection is the most important of its kind to come to market in over a decade. The 
collection spans the entire numismatic history of the early English peoples. Many of the coins are of exceptional 
quality and a high number have outstanding pedigrees. 

Among the many rarities offered in part one of the collection are a remarkable York Group Thrymsa (845); an 
extremely rare profile-lunettes penny of Archbishop Ceolnoth (863); one of the finest known portrait coins of Offa 
(869); very rare issues of the Mercian kings Ceolwulf I (882), Beornwulf (883), Berhtwulf (884) and Ceolwulf 
II (887); a very important group of coins of the Hiberno-Norse Vikings of York (901-904) and, in addition to an 
excellent run of portrait coins of the kings of Wessex, a wonderful flower type penny of Edward the Elder (914). 
The later issues include a beautiful Edward the Martyr (930). 

Further Anglo-Saxon coins from the Dr. Andrew Wayne collection will be offered in CNG 102 (May 2016) and 
Triton XX (January 2017).

Thomas Willoughby, 1st Lord Middleton (1672-1729) (Sotheby, 15 March 1926), lot 58; Sir Francis Willougby (1668-1688). 

The first son of Francis Willougby &apos;Willughby&apos; the elder (1635-1672), a founding father of British ornithology, Francis Willougby the younger 
was born in 1668. He had an unhappy childhood losing his father at the age of four, and later had a troubled relationship with his step-father 
Sir Josiah Child, who his mother married in 1676. Sir Josiah Child was an immensely successful merchant and politician who rose to become 
the Governor of the East India Company. While serving as Governor, Sir Josiah prosecuted a war against the Mughal Empire that would later 
be known as Child&apos;s War. Sir Francis ran away from home at the age of 12 and later took Sir Josiah to court claiming he had squandered his 
inheritance. Sir Francis formed a collection of coins, which included an important group of issues struck during the English Civil War and the 
Great Rebellion in Ireland. Amongst these was the rare Oxford Pound offered here. The collection passed to his younger brother Thomas on 
Sir Francis&apos;s death in 1688 and remained intact until it was sold by Sotheby in 1926.

The War of the Spanish Succession, sparked by Louis XIV of France in his attempts to expand his hegemony, flared into a continent-wide 
conflict, with France, Spain, and Bavaria opposed by a coalition centered around England, Holland, and Austria. One aim of the Allies was to 
deprive Spain of the wealth derived from its American colonies. When Admiral Sir George Rooke, commander of the combined fleet, learned 
the 1702 treasure had arrived at Vigo Bay in Spain, he resolved to seize it. His force of fifty ships besieged the harbor, destroying the French 
fleet guarding the convoy, sinking most of the ships and capturing cargo worth some 2 million pounds at the time. A special issue of gold and 
silver coins was struck from the captured plate and a number of medals honored the great victory.

Between 1568 and 1648, the Seventeen Provinces (mod. Benelux) revolted against Philip II of Spain, who had received the territories as 
part of the inheritance of his father, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Very quickly the revolt became an opportunity for outside interests, 
particularly England, to become involved as a way of indirectly attacking Spain. Following the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe, or formal declaration 
of independence from Philip in 1581, the northern provinces offered the crown to Elizabeth I. Preferring rather to continue with indirect 
aid, Elizabeth refused. However, the assassination of Willem van Oranje in 1584 compelled England to act in a more direct way. Under the 
terms of the Treaty of Nonesuch in 1585, Robert Dudley, First Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth&apos;s long-time favorite, was appointed Governor-
General and sent with an English expeditionary force to support the Dutch in 1586. Dudley, however, publicly unpopular, proved to be a poor 
commander and within a year of his arrival returned to England, eventually to command the land troops preparing for an anticipated invasion 
of England by the Spanish.

987. 
TUDOR. temp. Elizabeth I. 1558-1603. AR Medal (51mm, 40.70 g, 12h). Defeat of the Spanish Armada. By

from mount. Very rare. 
($1000) 

Ex Classical Numismatic Review XX.2 (Summer 1995), no. 945. 

As the destruction of the Spanish Armada consisted largely of a violent storm upon the seas, divine intervention is duly acknowledged upon 
the obverse of this medal. Since the armada was drawn chiefly against Elizabeth, the principal head of the Anglican Church, its cause was 
viewed as an attack upon the Church itself and is clearly represented on the reverse.

From the Frank S. Robinson Collection. 

Palembang, on Sumatra (Netherlands East Indies, today&apos;s Indonesia), was a sultanate until 1821, issuing mainly uniface lead-tin coins 
inscribed in Arabic. They have been quite scarce in numismatic commerce until recent river finds. Robinson&apos;s catalog was based on intensive 
analysis of 35,000 coins, selecting the best preserved example of each variety for illustration. Coins are in envelopes labeled with Robinson 
numbers. Most are individually very scarce; over half have rarity ratings of 9 or 10 on Robinson&apos;s 10-point scale. Probably the most complete, 
and the finest, collection of Palembang coins in existence. Accompanied by a signed copy of the book.
