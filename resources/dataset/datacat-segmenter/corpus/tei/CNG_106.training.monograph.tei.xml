AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) September 12, 2017. 

The Electronic Close starts at 10AM ET on September 13, 2017. Lots close every 20 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 10AM Eastern Time on the 
sale date, with subsequent lots closing every 20 seconds thereafter. All 
written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on 
the day prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bid-
ders up until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website 
represents the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid elec-
tronically must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations 
are processed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time 
only. No new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 21% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all successful 
written, fax, email and phone bids. A 19% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the 
hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www.cng-
coins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees.

This issue is truly enigmatic. It appears to mimic the issue of Athena/horseman hemidrachms struck on the Attic standard during the time of 
Timoleon and the Third Democracy (cf. SNG ANS 519-22), but there are two significant differences. The hemidrachms have three dolphins 
around the head of Athena, and they weigh between 1.75 and 2.15 grams. The four published pieces of the present issue weigh between 1.25 
and 1.36 grams. The consistent light weight and absence of the dolphins suggest that these are not simply hemidrachms of light weight. 
Another possibility (posed in Leu 81) is that these are hemidrachms on the Corinthian standard that was also used at that time at Syracuse, 
but hemidrachms on that standard are well known, and use typical Corinthian types: female head/forepart of Pegasos. The suggestion by Leu, 
that this might have been an early Corinthian standard hemidrachm issue that was too confusing due to its similarity to the Attic hemidrachms 
and was quickly replaced, is not convincing. Another possibility is that this is an issue struck on the litra standard (as cataloged in Nanteuil), 
which was also used during this period. Theoretically, these would be equal to 1½ litrai. Moreover, the known dilitrai used a horse type on 
their reverses, and their field markings suggest they were issued contemporary to the Attic hemidrachms. The star on the reverse of the present 
issue also suggests they were contemporary to the Attic hemidrachms and dilitrai. What is equally plausible, given their weight, is that these 
coins represent an issue of Attic diobols that were struck alongside the Attic hemidrachms with similar types.

the three pieces they illustrate, and none are visible on the present coin. CNP also questioned J&amp;L&apos;s reading, as a question mark is placed after

The attribution of this issue to Thasos is not certain, particularly given its relatively thick flan, plain square incuse punch, and the refined style 
of the dolphin. Tzamalis has identified electrum and silver coins from the Thraco-Macedonian region that have characteristics similar to this 
issue (cf. Tzamalis 21-22 [EL] and 42 [AR]).

Previously, this issue struck in the name of the Thracians was speculated to have been an issue struck at an uncertain mint in Thrace by 
Mithradates VI. However, Ilya Prokopov&apos;s die study of the Thasos tetradrachms established obverse die links between these coins in the 
name of the Thracians (ΘΡΑΚΩΝ) and those in the name of the Thasians (ΘΑΣIΩΝ), allowing for the former issues to be placed within 
the regular coinage. Prokopov agrees that the coins are likely struck during the Mithradatic period, but while Thrace was under the authority 
of the Romans, who allowed the administrator of the Temple of Dionysos to strike and circulate this coinage. MacDonald&apos;s further study 
confirmed Prokopov&apos;s placement of these within the ΘΑΣIΩΝ series, and identified an overstrike that established their absolute chronology. 
He theorized that these issues were used by the Romans to pay their Thracian mercenaries or allies.

KINGS of THRACE, Macedonian. Lysimachos. 305-281 BC. AR Tetradrachm (30mm, 17.06 g, 12h). Kyzikos 
mint(?). Struck circa 297/6-282/1 BC or shortly after. Diademed head of the deified Alexander right, with horn of Ammon / 
Athena Nikephoros seated left, left arm resting on shield, transverse spear in background; 5 to inner left. Thompson -; Müller 
528; Meydancikkale 2713-4 (same obv. die); Mektipini 163. Near EF, toned. 
($1000) 

From the George Bernert Collection. Ex Stack&apos;s (14 June 1993), lot 70. 

Seyrig (in Mektepini) placed this issue at Kyzikos, and all later attributions of this issue, including its staters (cf. Dewing 1356), have 
relied upon his placement. Such an attibution is not without question, since Seyrig did not note the reasons for it and the Lysimachos type 
tetradrachms of Kyzikos typically have a long torch that was a badge of the city. The present issue has no torch or other symbol signifying 
the city, and no die links are known between the torch issues and this monogram-only issue. Nonetheless, Seyrig did place this variety before 
the torch issues, likely based on the much higher degree of wear evident on the representative coin, and the fact that the torch issues appear 
to have a later style and fabric. If that placement is correct, it is possible that this issue was among the first at Kyzikos, before the civic badge 
was applied to the dies. The Meydancikkale coins also suggest this, as they, too, show moderate wear, the hoard is dated to the 240s BC, and 
none of the torch issues were found in that hoard. The history of Kyzikos during the Diadoch period is relatively unknown. Although no coins 
of Lysimachos&apos; lifetime have been attributed there, it is possible that this issue may have been a lifetime issue. It is also possible that this issue 
was authorized by Philetairos of Pergamon, under whose influence Kyzikos passed after the death of Lysimachos, and who also reintroduced 
Alexander type coins at Pergamon in the 280s.

Although Ouranopolis is not otherwise known to have issued for Lysimachos, the star on cone motif is the city&apos;s customary mintmark. If this 
is indeed a reference to the Chalkidian city, it would most likely date from mid to late 280&apos;s BC, corresponding to Lysimachos&apos; absorption of 
western Macedon into his kingdom.

C. M. Kraay suggested that this coinage is an early issue at Akanthos (ACGC, pp. 133-4), but K. Liampi disagrees, suggesting they are 
Euboian standard hemistaters issued at Stageira (Liampi p. 237).

111. 
THRACO-MACEDONIAN REGION, Uncertain. Circa 520-500 BC. AR Hemidrachm or Tetrobol (14.5mm, 
2.35 g). Grape bunch / Quadripartite incuse square. SNG Copenhagen 767; Boston MFA 1295; Weber 4731 (all as issue of

Ex Classical Numismatic Group 79 (17 September 2008), lot 137; Dr. Roland Maly Collection (LHS 100, 23 April 2007), lot 270; P.M. 
Proschowsky Collection (Rasmussen 245, 10 March 1970), lot 715; Durulfé Collection (Rollin et Feuardent, 9 May 1910), lot 479. 

This coin type has traditionally been attributed to the mint of Tenos in the Cyclades (see L. Artemis-Gyselen, &quot;Les monnaies archaïques de 
Ténos&quot; in RN 1977, class 2). However, more recent studies of the coinage of Tenos have concluded that this attribution was erroneous (see 
Sheedy, pp. 72-4, and R. Étienne &amp; L. Artemis-Gyselen, &quot;L&apos;Atelier monétaire de Ténos,&quot; in R. Étienne, Tenos II [Paris, 1990]). Sheedy&apos;s 
analysis of the metrology of these archaic coins has led him to place them at an uncertain mint in the Thraco-Macedonian region.

($1000) 

From the Belgica Collection, purchased from Salon Numismatique, Munich, in the 1990s. 

In his survey of the coinage of Terone, Hardwick questioned the authenticity of the Giessener Münzhandlung coin due to its low weight, and 
for the fact that the obverse type was an amphora, rather than an oinochoe, which he expected on all fractions. The present coin, though, is 
struck at the correct weight expected of a Euboic standard didrachm. Thus, the light weight of the GM piece, from the same die and punch, 
could be due to crystallization or some other natural cause. Hardwick&apos;s doubts regarding the typology are also not dispositive, since no other 
didrachms are known for the series, and so apparently the oinochoe is only canonical for smaller fractions.

First Gold of Alexander Type 

169. 
KINGS of MACEDON. Alexander III &apos;the Great&apos;. 336-323 BC. AV Stater (18mm, 8.59 g, 10h). Tarsos mint. 
Struck under Balakros or Menes, circa 332/1-327 BC. Helmeted head of Athena right, griffin on helmet / Nike standing left, 
holding wreath in extended right hand and cradling stylis in left arm; kerykeion below right wing. Price 3458 (Sidon, same 
obv. die as illustration); Newell, Dated 2, obv. die H (Sidon). Near EF, underlying luster, slightly off center. Excellent style 
and high relief. From the earliest series of staters of Alexander. Very rare. 
($2000) 

This issue was originally given to Sidon by Newell, along with seven other issues of staters (and two distaters) that lacked the mint signature 
and/or date that is found on nearly all other issues at Sidon. Newell later doubted the attribution, and suggested they may belong to an early 
mint at Damaskos (cf. G.F. Hill, &quot;Alexander the Great and the Persian lion-gryphon,&quot; JHS 43 [1923], p. 159). While Price retained Newell&apos;s 
original attribution, he, too, remained skeptical (Price, p. 436). Le Rider, in his recent review of the coinage of Alexander the Great (Alexander 
the Great: Coinage, Finances, and Policy [Philadelphia, 2007]), recounted the various arguments, but also assimilated more recent research, 
and convincingly argues that these eight issues of gold actually were the first issues of Alexander type staters at the mint of Tarsos (Le Rider, 
op. cit., pp. 134-9). 

The reattribution to Tarsos has a significant effect on the importance of these staters. It is generally thought that Alexander began issuing his 
new coinage, staters of Athena/Nike type and tetradrachms of Herakles/Zeus type, shortly after his capture of Tarsos in 333 BC. Recognizing 
the importance of this mint for Alexander, supported by the state of the evidence at the time, Newell originally attributed a large series of 
staters to the early period of Alexanders at Tarsos (E.T. Newell, &quot;Tarsos under Alexander,&quot; AJN 52 [1918]). Later research, however, moved 
nearly all of these issues to a mint in Macedon (cf. Price p. 371, and Troxell, Studies, pp. 99-110). This void of gold coinage is therefore filled 
with the reattribution of the eight issues from Sidon, resulting in these being not only the first issue of Alexander staters from Tarsos, but the 
first issues of Alexander&apos;s new stater coinage anywhere.

($1500) 

As noted by Troxell in her study of the Macedonian coinage of Alexander, there are issues marked with a thunderbolt (as Price 164) that are 
actually not from the primary Macedonian mint, which are differentiated by style. The present coin is significantly different from the standard 
Macedonian issues, particularly the crest of Athena and the general style of the portrait of Athena. However, this style is identical to a number 
of dies used on staters from an uncertain mint in western Asia minor that Newell and Price had originally placed at Salamis (Price 3134-7; 
see Troxell, New, for the dies and reattribution).

Although a reverse die match has not yet been identified, the die must have been engraved by the same hand as BM 2002,0101.375 and Münz 
Zentrum FPL 26 (1977), no. 38 (the latter of which was struck by the same obverse die as the present coin). Kolophon was one of the most 
prolific of the Alexander &quot;drachm mints,&quot; and is represented in most hoards of Alexander drachms. The present piece is likely an erroneous 
strike employing an unfinished die, rather than an intentional issue. The rarity of the type would thus be explained by the likelihood that the 
mistake was discovered and corrected after only a small number of strikes.

The new die combination that this coin presents is interesting, but perhaps more important is a feature on the reverse, one that is not clear on 
the Fitzwilliam piece that Newell saw for this die. On the present well-struck example, it is clear that the reverse die was originally engraved 
with another control mark, an A, below the star -thus the die was first used to strike Newell 52 tetradrachms and was then converted to the 
control marks of Newell 51. This revelation shows that Newell 51 could not precede Newell 52; they were either concurrent issues, or issue 
52 preceded issue 51.

Martin Price did not assign this issue to a particular mint, but Hyla Troxell suggested all the coins of her Group I were struck at the mint of 
Argos, while that city was under the control of a tyrant who was installed by Antigonos II Gonatas. However, the style and fabric of the coins 
of Group I are nearly identical to the issues of Demetrios I Poliorketes that Troxell and Price placed at Corinth around 300 BC.

The attribution of this issue to Antigonos Gonatas is not certain, but based on the similarity of the helmet symbol to that found on Gonatas&apos;s 
issues at Amphipolis and the fact that this issue is certainly later than the lifetime issues of Philip II. Stylistically, the portrait of Apollo is 
comparable to that found on royal portraits of the early-mid third century BC. Interestingly, Panagopoulou used the photo of this coin in her 
plate of Comparanda, but does not mention the coin in her text. 

Gonatas issued very little gold during his reign, thus, if the attribution is correct, it adds a new issue to a very scant coinage. In his study on 
the coinage of Gonatas, Mathisen notes that the very rare Alexander type gold struck in the name of Antigonos was likely issued to pay Celtic 
mercenaries that the king recruited to assist him in his war against Pyrrhos (see Mathisen, p. 103). The Philip II type staters were also still in 
circulation in the region, but circumstances for its issue under Gonatas may be similar to that of the Alexander type.

This type is traditionally thought to have been issued immediately following the suppression of the revolt of Philip VI Andriskos. As the 
Romans did not think the Macedonian people had supported Andriskos, they sent a peace embassy, instead of an army of occupation, after his 
defeat. The Latin legend LEG refers to &apos;legatio&apos;, an embassy, and the hand holding the olive branch an offer of peace. 

A.M. Burnett published a hoard (&quot;Aesillas: Two new hoards,&quot; CH VII) containing a small number of these tetradrachms along with various 
Athenian new style tetradrachms, Thasos tetradrachms, and Aesillas tetradrachms. Due to the light wear on the LEG MAKEΔONΩN 
tetradrachms, Burnett concluded that they were struck shortly before Aesillas&apos; issues, a downdating of approximately fifty years. Some 
numismatists have adopted this proposal (see Crawford, CMRR, p. 197). It seems more likely, however, that any apparent anomaly in degree 
of wear can be explained by the possibility that the hoard was assembled over a period of time, a supposition also supported by the other 
coinage found in the hoard. For example, the Athenian issues span the years 159/8-137/6 BC, and a number of these are also as well preserved 
as the Macedonian coins. The evidence of this single find is thus inconclusive, and should not override MacKay&apos;s analysis without further 
confirmation.

Monounios, an Illyrian king in the late 4th -early 3rd centuries BC, was the first Illyrian king to issue coins in his own name. The Illyrians 
consisted of a number of tribes whose habitation extended from the coast to the mountainous inland area bordering on Paeonia. These tribes 
were not politically unified, but it seems that they were connected by a common culture and language, and were governed by hereditary 
kings and queens. Little of their language is known, and it was extinct by the 5th century AD, but enough fragments are attested to classify 
it as Indo-European. Although little is known of Monounios&apos; reign, his issue of coinage took place only after he had extended his influence 
to Dyrrhachion, and the coinage may have been connected with his intervention in Macedonian affairs. In 280 or 279, it is reported that 
Monounios unsuccessfully aided Ptolemy I Epigone, son of Lysimachos, against Ptolemy Keraunos. A bronze helmet has been found in Lake 
Ohrid, on the border between modern-day Macedon and Albania, with the Greek inscription &apos;Of King Monounios&apos;, apparently confirming the 
presence of his army in this conflict of Macedonian succession. Pompeius Trogus (24,4) describes a &quot;Dardanian prince&quot; who offered Ptolemy 
Keraunos help against the invading Celts in 279. It seems likely that this prince was Monounios, and either Monounios had Dardanian 
heritage (references to which are not preserved elsewhere), or the distinction between Illyrian and Dardanian was unclear to the author.

($50,000) 

From the Ghazzat/Gaza 1960s hoard. 

The Ghazzat Hoard was found in the sea off the coast of Gaza in the 1960s. The coins from the hoard have been consigned by the Tarazi 
family, who acquired the coins immediately after they were found. In recognition of the importance of the hoard for scholars, the Tarazi family 
offered 27 of the hoard&apos;s 29 coins as a single lot in Triton XIX (lot 82). The present Delphi tridrachm was one of the two pieces previously 
retained by the family. 

The tridrachms of Delphi are among the most historically interesting of all Greek coins. Prior to the Asyut find they were only known from 
two coins in Paris and Berlin, as well as a fragment from the Zagazig Hoard of 1901 (IGCH 1645); now there are at least 14 examples. The 
obverse type is a direct reference to the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479, when a great deal of booty, including silver vessels, 
was taken by the Greeks. These two rhyta were certainly from that booty and must have been brought as a dedication to Apollo in Delphi 
(rams were sacred to Apollo, along with dolphins). The reverse of this coin is also very unusual: it is not a normal quadripartite incuse but, 
rather, clearly shows the stepped coffering that we know decorated ancient ceilings, especially those of prestigious buildings like the Temple 
of Apollo. The dolphins that ornament these coffers are a reference to both the name of Delphi and to the fact that Apollo himself could appear 
in the form of a dolphin.

This coin is part of a multi-denominational series of coins struck at Pantikapaion in the early 4th century BC. Based on the legend, numismatists 
once attributed these to a city of Apollonia in the Bosporos, but later research has shown that these are likely issues of Pantikapaion that are 
associated with that city&apos;s famous temple of Apollo Prostates. All of these issues have parallel types in the coinage signed with the ethnic of 
Pantikapaion.

Electrum of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), 
which constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now 
being continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by Hans von Fritze in 1914, 
augmented (and corrected) by the articles by Sylvia Hurter and Hans-Joachim Liewald. Hurter studied the electrum coinage of Kyzikos for 
some time before her untimely death in 2008. It was her conviction that the arrangement of the coins by Agnes Baldwin Brett in the catalog of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was the most accurate to date (reflected in the &quot;Editor&apos;s note&quot; at the beginning of the article on the Kyzikene 
coins in Moscow and St. Petersburg in SNR 2007). Thus, the coinage of Kyzikos below is arranged accordingly. 

More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has 
tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s 
inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

Myth of Erichthonios 

312.

Rosen -; Weber -; Kraay &amp; Hirmer 713. VF, toned, slightly off center. 
($5000) 

The myth of Erichthonios places him at the beginning of the line of Athenian kings. Born of Gaia through Hephaestus, the infant was entrusted 
to Athena, who gave him to the daughters of Kekrops of Athens in a sealed casket. When they opened the casket, the sight of the anguipedic 
(serpent-footed) Erichthonios drove the women to madness, and they hurled themselves off the Acropolis. Erichthonios was then left to 
found a new dynasty of the early kings of Athens. Although here the child is shown fully human, this rare Kyzikene stater is undoubtedly a 
representation of the beginning of this tale.

Unique Tetrobol

AEOLIS, Larissa Phrikonis(?). 4th century BC. AR Tetrobol (15mm, 2.82 g, 10h). Laureate head of Apollo right / 
Eagle, with spread wings, flying upward, head left; club to lower left. Unpublished, but cf. CNG 79, lot 318 for an obol from 
this issue. VF, toned, slight roughness. Apparently unique as a tetrobol. 
($300) 

A few obols of this type are known and have usually been attributed to Larissa Phrikonis. The attribution to this city is conjectural and is based 
largely on the fact that these do not fit among the coinages of the other known cities named Larissa. An example in Gorny &amp; Mosch 212, lot 
1951, was attributed to Larissa ad Kaystros in Ionia, but the reasoning is equally conjectural. The appearance of the present coin, the first 
tetrobol for the issue, adds some evidence to the puzzle. The style of the head of Apollo and the fabric of the flan are consistent with various 
other city coinage in the 4th century Troad, supporting the attribution to Phrikonis.

Late Hellenistic Stater of Magnesia 

376. 
IONIA, Magnesia ad Maeandrum. Circa 125-120 BC. AV Stater (18.5mm, 8.47 g, 12h). Euphemos, son of 
Pausanias, &quot;magistrate&quot;. Draped bust of Artemis right, wearing stephanos, hair drawn together and tied in the back, bow and 
quiver over shoulder / Nike, holding kentron in right hand, reins in left, driving fast biga of horses right; ÂÅ˝@˙tW[@] above, 
EUf˙Âos ∏ÅUsÅ@5o[U] in two lines below. Heritage 3096 (3 August 2017), lot 30066 (same dies); otherwise unpublished. 
Good VF, slight die rust. Well centered and struck. 
($20,000) 

The name on this issue is the same as that on an issue of stephanephori that was struck circa 150-140 BC. Whether these two issues name the 
same individual is uncertain. In his study of the stephanephoroi of Magnesia, Jones connected that individual with the neokoros of the temple 
of Artemis Leukophryene named in an inscription dated to 112/1 BC (IC III iv 9). If this is correct, then it would be reasonable to assume that 
this individual was also responsible for the present issue of staters. It is also possible that these similarly-named individuals were two members 
of the same family, such as a grandfather and grandson. 

The appearance of this previously unknown issue at Magnesia adds another city of western Asia Minor to the list of those that struck a gold 
coinage in the late Hellenistic period. Previously, such issues were known at Ephesos, Miletos, Smryna, and Tralles. Until Jenkins&apos; study 
of the Ephesos staters in 1987 (see Jenkins, Hellenistic), all of these were previously thought to have been issues struck in celebration of 
Mithradates VI&apos;s liberation of the cities from Roman control. With the exception of Smyrna and a discrete portion of the issues of Ephesos, 
all are now known to have been struck in the mid-late 2nd century BC, as there are direct parallels between the staters and various cistophori 
struck in their respective cities. All of these staters are civic in nature, featuring the patron deity of the city on the obverse, and reverses 
referencing aspects of each city&apos;s particular civic identity. 

The fact that Magnesia did not strike cistophori is one aspect that separates the present issue from the other cities&apos; gold. Thus, the dating 
of the issue relies upon the assumption that the &quot;magistrate&quot; named is the same as that found on the stephanophoroi, as noted above. The 
reverse design also distinguishes this issue. While the obverse is unexceptional, featuring the same profile portrait of Artemis found on the 
stephanephoroi and later bronze issues, the reverse with Nike driving a fast biga is quite perplexing, as it does not apparently represent an 
aspect of the civic mythology or identity, but rather an actual event. The type likely commemorates some victory that had a local significance, 
but our knowledge of Magnesia&apos;s history in the second century BC is scant. There are no political or military actions that are known for 
the period, but the type may be related to the games of the Leukophryena, which was an important panhellenic festival in honor of Artemis 
Leukophryene. If the &quot;magistrate&quot; named on the coin is the individual who held the position of the temple neokoros in 112/1 BC, then such 
a connection is quite likely.

In expiation for his murder of Iphitos at Tiryns, Herakles was ordered by the Delphic oracle to serve Omphale, the queen of Lydia, for one 
year. During this time, he performed a number of labors, similar to those which he undertook while serving Eurystheus, including the capture 
of the Kerkopes, the killing of the Syleus, and the conquest of the city of the Itones. At the same time, he was forced to wear women&apos;s clothing 
and spin wool and, according to the poet Ovid (Fasti 2.305), at one point during this time Omphale even wore Herakles&apos; lion skin and carried 
his club while ordering him about. However, these actions seemed to have little ill-effect on the hero; after his year&apos;s service was completed, 
Herakles married Omphale.

Through an examination of punches used, Spier linked this issue with a lion forepart to another featuring a boar&apos;s head. It is possible that the 
Kayhan piece is from a separate issue, as it has a subtly different style, and none of the punches used for that coin are used among the die-
linked coins.

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. The series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 10.6-10.7 grams, 
which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. Recent studies have shown that coins of both standards circulated together, but that 
the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which continued to be used into the Persian period. 
The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and &apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting 
that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. The present coin, however, is from an issue 
that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage are here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Weidauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was standardized. 
Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 25), and, like 
Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

Numismatically Important 

465. 
SELEUKID EMPIRE. Antiochos II Theos. 261-246 BC. AV Stater (17.5mm, 8.37 g, 6h). Aï Khanoum mint. 
Struck circa 261-256 BC. Diademed head of Antiochos I right, with elderly features / Apollo Delphios, testing arrow and 
holding grounded bow, seated left on omphalos; to inner left, star above arrow, ⁄ and kithara below. SC 617; SMAK 
A2A1S-1-3 var. (A1/P-[unlisted rev. die]); HGC 9, 228. VF, test cut on obverse. Numismatically important, the first known 
of this coinage with a test cut (see below). 
($2000) 

In SMAK (pp. 142-3), B. Kritt revisited his discussion regarding the chisel cuts found on so many gold staters from Baktria during the early 
Diodotid period. He reiterates his argument from his prior work, New Discoveries in Bactrian Numismatics (Lancaster, 2015), that the cuts 
were part of a program instituted by Euthydemos to validate the acceptance of staters then in circulation in Baktria, since he had immediate 
financial needs that would take too long to satisfy if he had to recall and restrike the coins in his own types. In this discussion, Kritt notes 
that there were no staters of Antiochos II type from Aï Khanoum that were known with these chisel cuts, although this coinage was quite vast. 
According to Kritt, the likely reason for this was that these coins were probably taken out of the country by Seleukid loyalists who fled Baktria 
when it was lost to the Diodotids during the reign of Antiochos II, thus none were still circulating when Euthydemos had the staters marked 
with the chisel cuts. As such, the present coin apparently was not removed from Baktria, is the first known example of an Antiochos II stater 
from Aï Khanoum to have one of the chisel cuts.

PHOENICIA, Sidon. Uncertain king. Early-mid 4th century BC. AR Dishekel (26mm, 25.73 g, 10h). Contemporary 
imitation. Phoenician galley left; waves below / Persian king and driver in chariot drawn by two horses left. E&amp;E-S App. V, 
15-6 (same obv. die); cf. HGC 10, 236, 242, 256, 258, 260, and 264 (for possible prototypes). VF, lightly toned, slightly soft 
obverse strike. Excellent metal. 
($750) 

This coin is struck from the same obverse die as two dishekels that E&amp;E-S listed among their &quot;false or doubtful&quot; coins (the authors considered 
their nos. 15 and 16 to have been from different obverse dies, but this is not correct; they definitely are the same). On close inspection, the 
fabric of the present coin is consistent with authenticity, though the style is not consistent with official products of the Sidon mint. E&amp;E-S no. 
16 was a coin offered in our Triton II sale, and it also had the appearance of a genuine ancient coin. Thus, it is more likely that these three 
coins, struck from one obverse and three reverse dies, represent an unofficial, imitative issue, rather than a modern forgery.

First Coinage of Babylon -Last Achaemenid Issue? 

516. 
PERSIA, Achaemenid Empire. temp. Darios III. Circa 333-331 BC. AV Double Daric (20mm, 16.53 g). Mint in 
Babylonia. Persian king or hero, wearing kidaris and kandys, quiver over shoulder, in kneeling-running stance right, holding 
dagger in right hand, bow in left / Patterned incuse punch. Carradice Type IV Late (pl. XV, 54); Meadows, Administration -; 
BMC Arabia pl. XX, 1; Sunrise 38. Near VF, off center, area of flat strike, minor die break on obverse. Extremely rare issue 
without control marks, only the BM and Sunrise pieces published. 
($2500) 

Carradice lists this issue among all the late double darics that he attributes as Alexandrine issues. Nicolet-Pierre, in her article on the 
Alexandrine gold and silver at Babylon, though, does not mention any Type IV Late double darics, only pieces similar to Type III, where the 
king/hero holds a spear, and all include control marks. This coin, like the Sunrise and BMC examples, shows no sign of control marks that are 
present on the Alexandrine coinage, and the style is closer to the standard darics of this type that Carradice gives to the time of Artaxerxes II 
to Darios III. Thus, it is possible that this was a very late, if not the last, Achaemenid issue, just prior to the defeat of Darios III. It probably 
was struck at the same Babylonian mint that later issued the double darics under Alexander, and may have been set up to provide coinage to 
the Persian king in Babylonia, as his western mints were no longer under his control. Regardless of whether this issue was made under Darios 
or Alexander, it is doubtless from the first coinage struck in Babylon.

Three Mazakes Tetradrachms 

517. 
PERSIA, Alexandrine Empire. Mazakes. Satrap of Mesopotamia, circa 331-323/2 BC. AR Tetradrachm (21mm, 
16.93 g, 9h). Imitating Athens. Helmeted head of Athena right / Owl standing right, head facing; olive spray and crescent to 
left. Le Rider, Alexander, pp. 214-9; Van Alfen, Owls, Group IIIa, 77 (same dies); Nicolet-Pierre, Monnaies, pl. 26, c var. 
(same obv. die, &quot;Mazakes symbol&quot; on rev.). VF, traces of undertype. Very rare. 
($500) 

Although this coin is struck with the standard Athenian ethnic, it is obverse die-linked to the Athens imitations in the name of Mazakes. 

Mazakes is best known as the Persian satrap who took over Egypt after Sabakes fell in battle against Alexander the Great&apos;s army at the 
Granicus, and later handed over the province peacefully to the Macedonian king. Imitative owls in the name of Mazakes have been known for 
some time, and all were originally attributed to his satrapy in Egypt. However, it was clear that stylistic elements separated the coinage into 
two general groups. More recent hoards, especially the 1973 Iraq hoard, have shown that one of the groups of imitative owls was certainly 
not struck in Egypt, but somewhere in the territory of modern day Iraq. In his analysis of the 1973 hoard, M. Price (&quot;Circulation at Babylon 
in 323 B.C.&quot; in W.E. Metcalf, ed., Mnemata: Papers in Memory of Nancy M. Waggoner [New York, 1991], pp. 63-72) changed the findspot 
from Iraq to the more specific cite of Babylon, based on anecdotal evidence (p. 63), and gave the series of Mazakes&apos; owls to the city. However, 
such an assignment has forced numismatists to conduct mental gymnastics in order to rationalize the presence of Mazakes&apos; coins at Babylon 
(cf. Van Alfen, Owls, pp. 27-33, and Le Rider, Alexander, pp. 215-7, for a summary of the previous research). 

It is clear that the attribution of the owls to Babylon is almost certainly incorrect, and other find evidence suggests an attribution to somewhere 
further north, perhaps in the satrapy of Mesopotamia (cf. Le Rider, op. cit., p. 217-9). In any event, this coinage clarifies the historical record 
regarding the disposition of Mazakes following his hand-over of Egypt, upon which subject the literary evidence is silent. As noted by Le 
Rider (op. cit., p. 215), one can compare Mazakes to other Persians who peacefully welcomed Alexander to their domains: Mazaios, who 
handed over Cilicia, was later made satrap in Babylon; and Mithrenes, who surrendered Sardes, was made satrap in Armenia. Also, the Persian 
noble Amminapes, who met Alexander in Egypt with Mazakes, was later made satrap of Parthia and Hyrkania. Thus, one would expect 
Mazakes to receive similarly favorable treatment, appointment to some position of authority. Interestingly, Mesopotamia is the only satrapy 
that is not addressed in the literary evidence when Alexander is organizing his eastern territories. As these tetradrachms of Mazakes are found 
in that region, and date to the period after Alexander&apos;s conquest, it is reasonable to suggest that Mazakes may have been appointed as satrap of 
Mesopotamia. It was also in the adjacent satrapy of Babylonia that Mazaios was allowed to strike a coinage in his name and types (influenced 
by his prior issues at Tarsos) for local use, and similar issues of local type and weight are known to have been issued at mints throughout the 
basin of the Tigris and Euphrates, from the time of Alexander to Seleukos I. Thus, these Athenian type tetradrachms likely constitute a local 
coinage of Mazakes, struck in the satrapy of Mesopotamia while he reigned there.

Pedigree Tetradrachm for Antiochos III of Syria 

563. 
BAKTRIA, Greco-Baktrian Kingdom. Agathokles Dikaios. Circa 185-175 BC. AR Tetradrachm (31mm, 16.44 g, 
12h). Commemorative issue struck for Antiochos III of Syria. Å@t5o≈oU down right, @5˚Åtoro% down left, diademed 
head of Euthydemos right / Zeus Bremetes, seen from behind, advancing left, aegis draped over outstretched left arm, and

HGC 12, 84; Triton XII, lot 402 (same obv. die). VF, lightly toned, granular surfaces, a few scrapes and circulation marks. 
($2000) 

The attribution of the individual on this tetradrachm, one of the series of pedigree issues struck by Agathokles, has been the subject of much 
discussion. Based on his own coinage, the portrait here is that of Euthydemos I. The legend -ANTIOXOY NIKATOPOΣ -suggests one of 
the early Seleukid kings of that name, and attempts have been made to associate the Antiochos on this tetradrachm with Antiochos II, who 
is named on the issues of Diodotos I. Jens Jakobsson (&quot;Antiochus Nicator, the Third King of Baktria?&quot;, NC 170 [2010], p. 25), while rightly 
arguing against Antiochos II as the person commemorated, he offered no alternative. Brian Kritt, who recently has revisited the issue (New 
Discoveries in Bactrian Numismatics, Chapter 5), convincingly suggests Antiochos III as the mostly likely candidate. Antiochos III, whose 
historical epithet is Megas (the Great), conducted a series of vigorous campaigns in the East, including the subjugation of the Parthians, his 
victories in Bactria, including the capture of Aï Khanoum, and his subsequent campaigning in India (p. 80). Like Alexander before him (who 
also figures in the pedigree series), Antiochos would have been a figure worthy of emulation by Agathokles and with whom he would wish 
to be associated.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson of 
Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalkis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of his rare coins name the 
emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius granted 
Herod authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

First Issue with the Portrait of a Jewish King 

616.

RPC I 4938. Fine, earthen green patina, minor cleaning marks. Extremely rare. 
($5000) 

This issue was the first to carry the portrait of a Jewish King. David Hendin (p. 257) notes: &quot;Philip was able to immortalize his face on his 
coins largely because so few Jews lived in the territories over which he ruled. Jews would have taken this act as an insult and violation of the 
Mosaic Law against &apos;graven images&apos;.&quot; 

Philip is repeatedly mentioned in the New Testament (see Matthew 14.3; Mark 6.17-29; Luke 3.1, 3.19).

Julius Marinus, Father of Philip the Arab 

621. 
ARABIA, Philippopolis. Divus Julius Marinus. Died circa AD 246/7. AE (23mm, 5.60 g, 6h). Struck at Antioch, 
circa AD 247-249. Bareheaded bust right, slight drapery on far shoulder, supported by eagle standing right / Roma or Allat 
standing left, holding patera and spear, with shield at side; S C across field. Butcher, Philippopolis &amp; Samosata, pl. 25, 11 
(same dies); Spijkerman 2 (same obv. die); SNG ANS 1402 (same dies); Saulcy 2. VF, earthen green patina. 
($2000) 

The father of Philip I, Julius Marinus hailed from a small town in the province of Arabia (modern day Shuhba, Syria; the original name of the 
ancient town is unknown). Following the death of Marinus, Philip deified his father and had a temple to him built in his newly aggrandized 
hometown -now renamed Philippoplis and elevated to the rank of colonia. 

The neat fabric of the city&apos;s coins is quite out of place for Arabia. This, combined with die links between the coins of Philippopolis, Zeugma, 
and Antioch, point to production at a central location, with Antioch being the likeliest candidate.

Portrait of Varus 
General at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest 

632. 
BYZACIUM, Achulla. Augustus, with Caius and Lucius Caesars. 27 BC-AD 14. AE (30mm, 11.85 g, 11h). 
Publius Quinctilius Varus, proconsul. Struck 8-7 BC. Bare head of Augustus left, flanked by smaller bare heads of Caius 
right and Lucius left / P QVINCT T LI VAR[I ACHV]LLA , bare head of Varus right. M. Amandry, &quot;Notes de numismatique

encrusted obverse. Extremely rare, only two in CoinArchives. 
($1000) 

Up until his final battle, Publius Quinctilius Varus was one of the most celebrated of Augustus&apos; generals. He had been consul in 13 BC (along 
with the future emperor Tiberius), governor of Africa in 8-7 BC, governor of Syria from 7-4 BC (where he had sent two legions into Judaea to 
quell local unrest after the territory was converted to a Roman province), and governor of Germania from AD 6 until his death in AD 9. In that 
year, Augustus had decided to straighten (and thereby shorten) Rome&apos;s borders by conquering the vast region of Germania beyond the Rhine. 
He assigned Varus to develop the region without war, but the mixed Gauls and Germans living there were unwilling to submit to Roman 
forces. The Cherusci under their king Arminius, along with other allies, ambushed Varus in the Teutoburg Forest of northwest Germany, and 
there annihilated the XVII, XVIII and XIX Roman legions in a pitched battle that lasted for three days. Varus, sensing doom, committed 
suicide, and when Augustus heard of the disaster, he is said to have torn his clothes and screamed, &quot;Varus, give me back my legions!&quot;. No 
further attempts were made to subdue the Germans beyond the Rhine until the reign of Domitian, and Varus was blamed for the collapse of 
imperial policy in Germany.

($750) 

As consul for the year 88 BC, Sulla was awarded the coveted assignment of suppressing the revolt of Mithradates VI of Pontus, but political 
maneuvers resulted in this assignment being transferred to Marius. In response, Sulla turned his army on Rome, captured it, and reclaimed his 
command against Mithradates. His prosecution of the first Mithradatic War was successful, but he spared the Pontic king for personal gain. 
In 83 BC, Sulla returned to Italy as an outlaw, but he was able to win the support of many of the leading Romans. Within a year he fought his 
way to Rome, where he was elected dictator. It was during this campaign to Rome that this denarius was struck. The obverse type represents 
Sulla&apos;s claim to be acting in Rome&apos;s best interest. The reverse shows Sulla enjoying the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire, the 
celebration of a triumph at Rome.

From the WN Collection. Ex Classical Numismatic Group 96 (14 May 2014), lot 772. 

This series of aurei and denarii featuring a throne on the reverse has two general varieties, based on the style of the back frame of the throne. 
One variety has a curved back (RIC II 121-3), while the other has a triangular back (RIC II 124-5). The former is known on aurei and denarii, 
while the latter is only known on denarii. However, the reverse of the present coin was struck with a die that was originally engraved with 
a triangular back. This is also indicated by the five crescent-like ornaments on the throne back. The curved variety always has only three 
ornaments, while the triangular variety has five or more. What is uncertain is the implication of this re-engraved die; was it intended for a 
heretofore unknown issue of aurei for the second variety, was it an error by a die engraver who had made dies for denarii of the second type 
and mistakenly engraved the aureus die with a triangular back, or is this coin struck with a die that was originally used for denarii of the second 
variety that was re-engraved for use on aurei?

Hadrian&apos;s Travel Series 

Between the years AD 119 and 136, the emperor Hadrian travelled throughout the Roman Empire, visiting various provinces to take stock of 
his inheritance and calm the disquiet which had arisen in the later years of Trajan&apos;s reign. His travels can be divided into two major episodes. 
The first tour was designed to shore-up Rome&apos;s northern borders and began sometime around AD 119 when Hadrian first visited the provinces 
of Gaul and Germania Inferior and Superior. The emperor then crossed the Channel to Britannia where, during his stay, construction began 
on a 73-mile long wall across the north of the province. In AD 122-123, Hadrian spent time in Hispania, then travelled East to Asia Minor. 
The remainder of this first tour was spent in the Balkans and Greece, touring such areas as Dacia and Achaea, before returning to Rome, via 
Sicily, in AD 126. 

Hadrian&apos;s second tour began in AD 128, when he set out on a short tour of the provinces of Africa and Mauretania. Returning for a brief stay 
in Rome, Hadrian then went again to Asia Minor, and continued into the Levant. In AD 130, Hadrian moved on to Egypt, where he visited 
Alexandria. It was while Hadrian was on tour in Egypt that his favorite, Antinoüs, mysteriously drowned in the Nile. The Bar Kochba revolt 
in Judaea forced Hadrian to remain in the region until AD 135. In AD 136, Hadrian returned to Italia, ending his long travels.

Mattingly originally assigned this type to the large number of anonymous quadrantes issued in the general period of the late first and early 
second centuries. He dismissed the assertion of Cohen, however, who gave it to Annius Verus, the deceased twin of the emperor Commodus. 
The presence of several consistent varieties of the type prompted Van Heesch to retain the Antonine attribution, but to identify the portraits 
instead as personifications of the seasons, representations of the abundance present in Rome&apos;s &quot;Golden Age.&quot;

It was a great misfortune that Rome&apos;s most philosophically-minded emperor spent much of his reign preoccupied with the practical affairs 
of waging war. The Parthian War (AD 161-166) demanded that many troops stationed in the northern provinces be moved east. The 
Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatiae all quickly capitalized on the decreased military presence and swarmed southward, even posing a threat to 
Italy. Marcus took personal command in AD 167 and managed to establish peace through a series of hard-fought victories, which this scarce 
issue commemorates. It was during these campaigns that Marcus began writing his famous philosophical work, Meditations.

An interesting contemporary counterfeit that combines an obverse for Marcus Aurelius with a reverse for Commodus, and the legends on 
both sides are blundered. Contemporary counterfeits of Roman coins are often hybrids; perhaps counterfeiters did this intentionally to provide 
themselves with a potential defense that their products were not actually copies of genuine coins. The blundered legends would further support 
this theory.

Hadrian, childless and without either a successor or heir, chose Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his adopted son in AD 136, and renamed him 
as Lucius Aelius Caesar. Aelius was sent to the Roman province of Pannonia to serve as governor, where he died of tuberculosis in AD 138. 
Hadrian now made his second choice for his heir, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Antoninus. Hadrian actually wanted Marcus Aurelius to 
succeed him on the throne, but realized that Aurelius was far too young, so instead he went with the highly respected Antoninus. As a condition 
of his adoption, and to ensure an orderly line of succession, Antoninus Pius adopted both his nephew, Marcus Aurelius, and Aelius Caesar&apos;s 
son, Lucius. The relatively young Lucius would change his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, but he would later drop Commodus 
and add Verus after ascending to the throne, along with his adoptive brother and co-ruler Marcus Aurelius. The present type depicts the two 
&quot;brothers&quot; and co-rulers clasping hands with an inscription noting the &quot;harmony&quot; between the two Augusti.

($1000) 

The very rare aurei of this eastern style were first studied in depth by S. Laffranchi, who noted stylistic similarities between these coins 
and contemporary potin issues of Alexandria. P. Webb (in RIC) agreed with Laffranchi&apos;s comparison, but added that there was also stylistic 
similarities with certain issues of Carus at Cyzicus, and thus left the mint attribution as uncertain. K. Pink later dismissed these gold coins 
as merely imitations, but without explanation (interestingly, Webb notes that before reading Laffranchi&apos;s paper, he was inclined to call them 
imitations of issues from Cyzicus). To the present cataloger, though, the organized typology of these coins suggest an official issue that 
commemorates the campaigns of Carus and Carinus in the east: the aurei are known in the name of both emperors, and each has reverses 
naming the other (VICTOR CARO AVG and VICTOR CARINO AVG), accompanied by the standard figure of Victory. If not struck at 
Alexandria, then perhaps these were all struck by a mint that accompanied the emperors on campaign.

Aurei with the CONCORDIAE AVGG NN reverse are known for Diocletian, Maximianus, Constantius and Galerius, thus placing this issue in 
AD 293, the year the First Tetrarchy was fully established with two junior rulers (Constantius I and Galerius as Caesars), and when Diocletian 
(for the fifth time) and Maximianus (for the fourth time) held the joint-consulship. 

Which mint struck these unsigned issues has long been debated. Pink, in laying out the gold issues of the First Tetrarchy, assigned the unsigned 
aurei to Cyzicus, including the CONCORDIAE AVGG NN reverse issue. Webb, however, assigned the coin to Antioch. Although he gave 
no specific reason for doing so, he did note in his discussion of the Cyzicus mint (p. 215) a close association between the two mints. He also 
noted the existence of Pink&apos;s article, but did not incorporate its findings (p. 219). Since then, attributions for these unsigned issues have varied 
among numismatists and catalogers. One can see obverse stylistic affinities between these aurei and later marked issues of Antioch (Lukanc 
5 [p. 175, 3]). Unfortunately, as Sutherland (RIC VI, p. 597 [Antioch]) points out in his discussion of the mint, these early issues have been 
studied out of context, and only a more detailed study of this early coinage (preferably a die-study) will provide a more satisfactory answer.

L. Domitius Alexander led a short-lived revolt against Maxentius from AD 308 to 311, holding Africa and Sardinia. There is little known about 
this usurper, but there is evidence in an inscription (CIL VIII, 22183) that he and Constantine allied themselves in opposition to Maxentius. 
P. Salama in &quot;Recherches numismatiques sur l&apos;usurpateur africain L. Domitius Alexander,&quot; Proceedings of the International Numismatic

There has been a bit of a debate over the date of this coin with its unusual, for the period, reverse type. C.H.V. Sutherland, the author of volume 
VI of RIC, suggests it was struck in 310 or 311 to celebrate Constantine&apos;s victories over the Alemanni and the Franks. Pierre Bastien connected 
it to no specific donative, while Georges Depeyrot assigns it to 312-313, presumably in honor of Constantine&apos;s victory over Maxentius at the 
Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Constantine was now the sole ruler of the West, and had purportedly cordial relations with Licinius I, who would 
emerge victorious in his struggle with Maximinus I and rule the East.

Selections from the East Harptree Hoard of 1887 

CNG is pleased to present a selection of coins from the East Harptree Hoard of 1887. This hoard was discovered near the village of East 
Harptree, located approximately 16 miles southwest of Bath. The hoard consisted of 1496 silver coins, five silver ingots, and a Roman silver 
ring set with a carnelian intaglio stone. The coins are 4th century, covering the period of Constantine the Great to Gratian (circa AD 306 to 
383). The landowner, Mr. William Kettlewell, made the hoard available to the British Museum, and it was first written up by John Evans in 
The Numismatic Chronicle of 1888 (pp. 22-46). The British Museum kept 25 of the most interesting coins from the hoard, and the rest of 
hoard was returned to the owner. 

A portion of the hoard, along with the original jug that contained them, was given to a local church for display by William Kettlewell&apos;s son, 
Colonel Kettlewell. These were eventually stolen. Many years later, the balance of the hoard, nearly 1200 pieces, was given to the father of the 
individual who subsequently consigned the hoard to Spink, where they were sold last September. Spink wrote-up the hoard for their INSIDER 
Magazine (Summer 2016 issue). Overall, the quality of the Harptree Hoard is exceptional. The coins exhibit beautiful surfaces with lovely 
cabinet toning, with very little clipping -remarkable condition for coins of this period. 

A rare opportunity to own a coin from a documented hoard found 130 years ago.

($1000) 

Based on the mintmark, this siliqua of Valentinian from the Siscia mint was struck as part of a festal issue commemorating the tenth regnal 
anniversary of Gratian and in anticipation of the fifteenth of Valens. While Valentinian, who had become emperor in AD 375, was included in 
the program of the anniversary issues for Valens -hence RIC IX 19 -the young emperor had not yet reached the regnal milestone of five years 
that normally began the issuance of such special issues. Thus, this siliqua, bearing the Christogram within the wreath on the reverse would 
provide an appropriate alternative for the Christian Valentinian, who (along with his mother) later became embroiled in the Arian controversy.

Confirming a Possible New Mint for Zeno 

Based on the CONOR in the exergue, Lacam assigned the following two coins to an issue struck under the Ostrogothic king Theoderic, 
an attribution which catalogers of these coins have generally adopted. M.A. Metlich, in his recent study of the Ostrogothic coinage (COI), 
however, states that no solidi in the name of Zeno can be attributed to Theoderic, implying that such issues must be official coinages of the 
emperor. In fact, P. Grierson noted a Zeno with Leo tremissis with the CONOR mintmark in Dumbarton Oaks (DOCLR 628), which he 
assigned to Constantinople. While CONOR is suggestive of an unofficial or imitative issue, examples with this mintmark are recorded with 
one of seven different officina letters -A, B, Γ, Δ, Є, Z, and Θ. So many officina letters are unknown in contemporary Germanic issues that 
imitate imperial coinage, and rather suggest a well-structured official mint whose identification is not yet certain.

before his rise to the throne. 
($500) 

After Constantine V, brother-in-law of Artavasdus, succeeded Leo III, Artavasdus attacked him en route to a campaign against the Umayyads 
and usurped the throne. Artavasdus&apos; reign saw an overturn of Leo&apos;s strict iconoclastic policies, but his orthodox efforts would ultimately be 
short-lived and his restoration of the icons in turn reversed. Artavasdus&apos; forces were defeated by Constantine V in the summer of 743. On 2 
November of the same year, he and his son Nicephorus, whom he had raised to co-emperor, had their eyes put out in the Hippodrome. 

Prior to his rise to the purple, the Armenian-born Artavasdus was appointed strategos by Anastasius II in circa 713. He supported Leo III, 
then governor of the Anatolic theme, in his revolt against Theodosius III -an alliance that was sealed with Artavasdus receiving the hand of 
Leo&apos;s daughter Anna, as well as the titles of kouropalates (&quot;master of the palace&quot;) and the position of komes of the Opsikion. For a similar 
seal that carries the additional title of &quot;komes of the Opsikion&quot;, see G.L. Schlumberger, Sigillographie de l&apos;empire byzantin [Paris: E. Leroux, 
1884], p. 249, 2).

Michael was the Patriarch of Constantinople when mounting tensions between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches gave 
way to the Great Schism of 1054, a highly contentious year that would see Pope Leo IX and Michael excommunicate each other (Pope Paul 
VI and Patriarch Athenagoras nullified the excommunications in 1965). Michael was also deeply involved in the maneuvering that led to the 
abdication of the Byzantine emperor Michael VI in 1057, and reached the height of his power early in the reign of the new emperor Isaac I, 
who at first was little more than the patriarch&apos;s puppet. Michael&apos;s open use of imperial power led Isaac, fearing a total rebellion, to have the 
patriarch deposed and exiled.

This coin comes from a hoard of John VIII and Constantine XI published by Simon Bendall in 1991 (see Bendall, Coinage). Prior to the hoard, 
the coinage of Constantine was only known from two specimens. Bendall believed the eighth stavrata of Constantine to be &quot;prime contenders 
for being the very last coins struck in the Byzantine Empire&quot; (p. 141), and thought those with the shortened &quot;KC&quot; form of the emperor&apos;s name 
to be the final eighth stavrata to be struck. Several contemporary sources specifically tell us that Constantine ordered sacred vessels to be 
removed from churches and melted down to strike coins as payment to his soldiers (Bendall pp. 140-1).

From the Belgica Collection. Ex Tkalec (28 February 2013), lot 235. 

This coin belongs to a rare issue that has been attributed to Nicaea in the past, but Simon Bendall&apos;s analyses of these coins reveal that they are 
more likely early issues of Trebizond under Andronicus Gidon. It could possibly be his second issue after a seemingly unique copper trachy 
with his name followed by &quot;Comnenus,&quot; a family from which he did not hail. The extreme rarity of that issue may indicate that his fallacious 
association with the Comneni was not well received. 

The icon of Christ Chalkites was kept in vestibule of the imperial palace at Constantinople and was closely associated with the emperor. Its 
appearance here may reflect hopes of a reunited Byzantine Empire.

In his introduction to the reign of Honorius in RIC (p. 135), J.P.C. Kent notes that these siliquae with PSRV mintmark were struck by the 
Visigoths in Gaul, probably at Narbonne. Issues are known in the name of Priscus Attalus (RIC 3701-2) and Honorius (RIC 3703), the former 
with reverse legends ending both ΛVGG and ΛVGGG, but the latter only with ΛVGG. The present coin is the first attested in Honorius&apos; 
name with ΛVGGG on the reverse. In his 1989 address to the Royal Numismatic Society (J.P.C. Kent, &quot;The President&apos;s Address,&quot; NC 149 
[1989], pp. i-xvi), Kent noted that the Visigoths minted the issues in the name of Attalus around 415, during an attempt to resurrect their 
candidate for Western emperor (ibid., pp. iv and xv). It is uncertain whether the issues in the name of Honorius were struck before, during, or 
after these, but the two coinages are certainly related. Kent dated all of the Visigothic coinage in the name of Honorius to c. 418-423 (ibid., 
p. xv), but the earlier date should be 415, based on the possible dates he set out for this issue. During this period, the successive kings of the 
Visigoths were Athaulf (410-415), Sigeric (415), Wallia (415-419), and Theodoric I (419-451). All of the silver issues of the Visigoths in Gaul 
are extremely rare.

The argentei minuti are the earliest silver coinage attributed to the Merovingian period. They are all copies of late 4th century Roman siliquae, 
with weights ranging from 0.40 to 0.20 grams, and are found primarily in the region between the Seine and Rhine rivers in northern Francia, 
which corresponds to the medieval regions of Austrasia and Neustria. Most have been found in graves, and were holed and worn on a necklace 
or bracelet, apparently as payment by the deceased to Charon to gain passage over the river Styx (&apos;Charon&apos;s obol&apos; or &apos;viaticum&apos;). As noted in 
MEC, the exact purpose of these coins is uncertain, but there is anecdotal literary evidence that they were disbursements to the poor by the 
king. While some pieces bear good Latin legends, many are partially or completely degraded as on the present piece.

The Venetian style imitative ducati copying the types such as Andrea Dandolo are traditionally attributed to Robert d&apos;Anjou (de Taranto) as 
the Prince of Achaea, but their widespread circulation and their numerous varieties leaves open the possibility of other minting sites, such 
as Chios under Genoa or Mytilene under the Gattilusi, as these venues served as the principal trade currency of the Crusader east for several 
decades in the last half of the 14th century.

WORLD COINAGE

AUSTRALIA, Private Token Issues. Thomas Brownhill, convict, transported 1831-1832. AE Convict Love 
Token (35.5mm, 23.25 g). Man standing right on shore, doffing hat, holding irons attached to his legs; to right, ship under sail

Town, South Australia, 1998), p. 110 (for another token of Brownhill). Good VF. Recently discovered in a house clearance in 
the UK. 
($2000) 

Thomas Brownhill was tried and convicted at the Warwick Assizes on 26 March 1831 for housebreaking, and sentenced to transportation. He 
sailed from Portsmouth on the Isabella on 27 November 1831, bound for Sydney. The voyage was marked by a mutiny of the ships crew, with 
fourteen being executed upon their arrival in Australia. But the convicts, Brownhill included, remained well-behaved, and are even reported 
to have helped the captain. Following their arrival in Australia, Brownhill was assigned to one W.T. Morris of Batemans Bay, where he died 
on 13 December 1840. . 

Brownhill is surprisingly known from another token in the Peter Lane Collection, bearing the initials and ages of his family members. Other 
records describe him as literate, a Birmingham-born Protestant, and a &apos;fancy plater&apos; by trade, with a tattoo on his lower right arm of a man 
and a woman and his initials.

($500) 

In June of 1688, Portuguese authorities ordered the revaluation of all silver coins validated for circulation under a March 1663 edict. 
Underweight and clipped pieces were withdrawn and melted, while specimens that were of sufficient weight were restruck by a circular 
countermark and edge pattern, to discourage further alterations. Curiously, the legends that appeared on the initial issues were reused, resulting 
in coins in the names of João IV and Alfonso VI being effectively restruck after their deaths.

Frederick II Hohenstaufen, &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot; (&quot;Wonder of the World&quot;), was the most enlightened ruler of the medieval European world, and 
single-handedly almost ignited a renaissance a century before it took hold in western Europe. Besides encouraging the study of both the 
ancient and natural worlds (he wrote an insightful treatise on falconry), Frederick was instrumental in improving relations with the Muslims, 
negotiating free access to Christian holy sites in Palestine, where all Crusader armies had been unsuccessful. One of his innovations was a 
gold coinage comparable in style and quality to the gold of the ancient Caesars. The classical motifs proclaimed his inheritance of the legacy 
of Rome, and the augustale and its fractions were issued concurrently with the publication of the Constitution of Melfi, his codification of 
Norman law meant to follow the famous Roman law codes. These coins were struck until Frederick&apos;s death in 1250, and may have been 
continued by his successors for about another fifteen years.

The 1715 Treasure Fleet was a Spanish fleet returning with some of the wealth from its colonies in the Americas to Spain. A hurricane sank 
most of the ships in the fleet (eleven of the twelve ships) in the early morning of 31 July 1715 near present-day Vero Beach, Florida. Because 
the fleet was carrying silver, it is also known as the 1715 Plate Fleet, since plata in Spanish means silver. The wrecks were salvaged by the 
Real Eight Company, founded by Kip Wagner, from whose collection this piece originates.

LAGROUS,/ Succ r . de M. LÉVEILLÉ,/ à Paris. Lot also includes 14 monochrome prints of the life of Napoléon from an uncertain Russian 
publication. 
($15,000) 

A M. Legrous is known at 65 Quai de l&apos;Horloge from a report on an adding machine he invented (Bulletin de la Société d&apos;encouragement pour 
l&apos;industrie nationale. Vol. 27, no. 294, December 1828, p. 394-7). Later, in a report on the 1867 Exposition Universelle, the Gellée brothers, 
leather case makers, are noted as having taken over the business from M. Lagrous in 1832 (Exposition universelle de 1867: Rapports du jury 
international, Volume 3 -Groupe III, Classes 14 a 26, 1867, p. 452). Combined with the presence of a medal produced by the Englishman J. 
Mudie in 1820, the period this collection was completed can be narrowed to sometime between 1820 and 1832.

The Ordem Militar de Cristo (Military Order of Christ) is a Portuguese honorific order, founded by king Diniz I in 1317. This order was 
reconstituted from the ashes of the former Knights Templar, which had been aboloshied by Pope Clement V&apos;s bull, Vox in excelso in 1312. 
Diniz negotiated with the Pope to take control of the Templar assets in Portugal, and in 1619 Pope John XXII granted his blessing to the 
revival of the Catholic order. The organization was secularized in 1789 and temporarily extinguished with the dissolution of the monarchy in 
1910, though it was again revived in 1917. Today, the order is awarded to individuals displaying outstanding military merit. Previous members 
include the explorers Henry the Navigator and Vasco de Gama. The order&apos;s cross emblem is the same that decorated the sails of Christopher 
Columbus&apos; Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria.

BRITISH COINAGE 

1068. 
CELTIC. &apos;Ring Money&apos;. Circa 1150-750 BC. AV Plated AE (20mm, 13.18 g). Thick gold-plated bronze band with 
thin silver inlay pattern. Van Arsdell 1-3; ABC p. 202; SCBC p. 117; cf. Quiggin p. 279-81; Opitz p. 280. VF, splits near 
terminal. Rare this large. 
($1500) 

Although not conclusively identified as an early form of money, these rings have been found in hoards and do bear some resemblance to 
other Celtic objects accepted as &quot;proto-money&quot;, such as small bronze or potin wheels. R.D. Van Arsdell, in his book Celtic Coins in Britain, 
notes that precious-metal rings such as this &quot;may have had multiple functions; as items of personal adornment (many were hair ornaments), 
as a means of displaying wealth, and as a medium of exchange. The weights and diameters vary, making it difficult to establish whether 
denominations existed.&quot; The authors of ABC, on the other hand, regard these as jewelry and ornaments, albeit with some ceremonial wealth-
storage value attached. 

1069. 
CELTIC, Imported coinage. Ambiani. 2nd century BC. AV Stater (17mm, 6.35 g, 1h). Gallo-Belgic Ca, Class

Found near Weston, North Yorkshire, March 2017. 

Gold Shillings of the distinctive York Group have been the subject of extensive debate and interpretation. Forthcoming publications by Tony 
Abramson and Mary Garrison argue convincingly that these rare gold coins were an Episcopal issue closely connected with the nascent 
Northumbrian church and date to the commencement of English coinage. The reverse legend of this type is read as a &apos;nomina sacra conveying 
a benediction on York or its king&apos; (T. Abramson &apos;The Northern Primacy,&apos; BANS 2017 Catalogue).

This exceptional type was once thought to depict the Shrine of St. Cuthbert, based on an interpretation of the reverse legend as SCT CVÐ. 
However, current scholarship agrees that the type belongs firmly to the series of small bronze stycas bearing the names of moneyers, and that 
the legend is more properly interpreted as the CVD CLS, for the moneyer Cuthgils

Eardwulf acceded to the Northumbrian throne in the tumultuous period following the assassination of Aethelred I in 796. Eardwulf had 
helped organise the murder of Aethelred in revenge for Aethelred&apos;s earlier, nearly successful, attempt on Eardwulf&apos;s life. Eardwulf&apos;s reign 
was characterised by conflict with Coenwulf of Mercia who gave asylum to his enemies. In the late eighth century, close ties existed between 
the Northumbrian and Frankish courts and it may have been that Eardwulf married an illegitimate daughter of Charlemagne. Eardwulf was 
deposed in 806 by the shadowy Aelfwald II and went on pilgrimage to Rome and visited the Emperor&apos;s court in Nijmegen. Frankish sources 
suggest he may have reclaimed his kingdom in circa 808 before being succeeded by his son Eanred, possibly around 810. No coins were 
known of Eardwulf before the Burton Fleming find in 1994 (EMC 1995.6001; Pirie, BNJ 1995, pp. 20-31). This is the first coin of Eardwulf 
to be offered for sale in a public auction.

Anglo-Viking Weight 

1088. 
ANGLO-SAXON, Anglo-Viking (Danish East Anglia)(?). Late 9th century. PB 2 Ertugar or 2/3 Eyrir Weight 
(18mm, 17.69 g). Circular lead weight, inset with two stycas of AEthelred II of Northumbria, from his 2nd reign (843/4-849/50), 
with the obverses facing outward; one side is motif type 1a, the same obverse die as SCBI 68 (Lyon), 398, while the other is 
motif type 1b, the same obverse die as SCBI 68 (Lyon), 401-2. Cf. G. Williams, &quot;Anglo-Saxon and Viking Coin Weights,&quot; in 
BNJ 69 (1999), nos. 9-10 for similar weights with coins of AEthelred II inset. VF. Very rare and interesting. 
($1000) 

Williams&apos; analysis of the known weights of this type clearly places them in the Danelaw during the later ninth century, when the Viking 
economy was still bullion-based, and weights were used for weighing both coinage and bullion. 

The purpose of the coins set into these weights remains uncertain, but Williams suggests that they served both a decorative and a practical 
function as a symbol of authority. Although the Viking economy was still pre-monetary, Williams notes that the Vikings were familiar with 
coinage and likely recognized that coin designs represented state authority. He also suggests that the Vikings were probably familiar with 
Anglo-Saxon coin weights, which were validated by the virtue of being stamped with official dies, and argues that the lack of coin dies for use 
on their own weights was remedied by applying a coin within each. Williams points out that the fact that some of the coins used were issued 
by Anglo-Saxon kings would have been irrelevant, as the vast majority of the Vikings were illiterate.

($3000) 

The small village of Torksey is situated on the eastern bank of the River Trent at the entrance to the Roman canal system, known in later times 
as the Foss Dyke, that connects the river to the city of Lincoln some ten miles to the south east. The strategic importance of Torksey was 
recognized by the leaders of the Great Heathen Army who chose it as their winter quarters in 872/3. A mint was opened there during the reign 
of Edward the Martyr but output was very limited and sporadic. The vast flow of coin from nearby Lincoln would have more than satisfied 
any local demand. Staffed by moneyers usually found striking at Lincoln, Torksey only seems to have been brought into use when the need to 
raise the massive Danegelds, required to pay off marauding Viking armies, necessitated a huge increase in production across the country. The 
helmet type of Cnut was the last issue at Torksey.

Silver Ingot From The Pimprez Hoard 

1112. 
NORMAN, temp. Civil War. 1135-1154. Cast AR Puddle Ingot. Dimensions of ingot: 65x58 mm; thickness; 12 
mm. Weight: 134.68 grams. A cast puddle ingot with slightly convex and pitted face containing traces of the gray-green 
sediment matrix. The convex top of the pour shows large bubble-produced cavity, revealing shiny silver content. The additional 
whorling suggests that the metal was poured slowly while cooling. Traces of black slag from the smelting process present.. 
Pimprez 574 (this ingot). As made. An excellent example of medieval precious metal smelting. 
($1000) 

Ex Spink 170 (6 October 2004), lot 487 and back cover; 2002 Pimprez (Oise) Hoard. 

Made by pouring molten silver into a scooped-out hollow of clay or sand (Pimprez, p. 277), individual ingots of this type have been found in 
hoards in Belgium (Courcelles 1965) and Germany (Fulda 1897). Where such ingots appear in quantity, however, are the large twelfth-century 
and later bracteate hoards from Saxony. Although our ingot does not conform to the weight standard of any of the aforementioned ingots, its 
similarity to these examples suggests that our ingot may be of an origin in Lower Saxony. While it is likely that this ingot was part of the earlier 
German portion of the Pimprez Hoard, it is quite possible that it was part of an English royal treasury. William of Malmesbury (Historiae 
Novellae I.14), noted that the treasury of Stephen&apos;s predecessor, Henry I, consisted of silver (and gold) vessels, as well as coins -though other 
form, like ingots, may have been included. Furthermore, royal castles in Normandy generally served as continental treasure repositories for 
the English kings (Marjorie Chibnall, &quot;Orderic Vitalis on castles,&quot; in R. Liddiard, ed., Anglo-Norman Castles [Woodbridge, 2003], p. 123). 
It would not be extraordinary for the King&apos;s treasuries in his overseas possessions to include foreign bullion brought into his realm as feudal 
payments or gifts, and thus account for the presence of this ingot.

24 Copies Remain 

Cohen, Edward E. Dated Coins of Antiquity. Shekels of Tyre -Supplemental Photographs (Release 2). 2017. Hardbound. 
551 pp. with nearly 1000 photos illustrating the text. (GR). (GR357) $135 

Among the more popular sections of Dated Coins of Antiquity (DCA) (pages 501 to 515) has been the date and its rarity listing for the silver 
shekels of Tyre and the smaller half, quarter and eighth shekels bearing the local god Melkart. These coins were struck nearly continuously 
for 191 years, from 126 BC to 66 AD. In addition to the date written with Greek letters, most of these coins also carry a monogram (usually 
also in Greek letters) and a Phoenician letter -alef or bet. This first photographic supplement encompasses more than 500 different varieties 
of these coins, defined by their varying dates, monograms, Phoenician letters and the four denominations in silver. With the rarity listing of 
dates in DCA, this supplement presents the most comprehensive catalog of the reported dates, monograms and varieties for the shekels of 
Tyre and its minor silver denominations. 

CNG is pleased to publish a limited hardcover edition of Dated Coins of Antiquity. Shekels of Tyre -Supplemental Photographs (Release 
2). Release 2 nearly doubles the coverage contained in the prior release. This volume does not duplicate the material in the original Dated 
Coins of Antiquity (DCA), which catalogs over 6000 coins of the ancient world dated before the millennium divide, 1 BC / AD 1. Release 2 
encompasses the most extensive date listing and photographic evidence for these dated coins struck nearly annually for 191 years, 126 BC 
through AD 65. 

Release 2 has a chapter for each denomination and date that the author has confirmed in museums, private collections and the market. It 
includes full-size photos and an enlargement of the date, monogram and Phoenician letter (alef or bet). Nearly 1,000 photos are contained in 
551 pages. Tables and graphs report the aggregate counts in museums of shekels and half shekels by year. Additional tables summarize the 
varieties of the shekels and half shekels and monograms each year that are contained in DCA-Tyre. Illustrations depict all the different forms 
of the monograms and Phoenician letters.

Advance Orders Now Being Taken 
Handbook of Coins of Macedon and Its Neighbors, Part II 

Hoover, Oliver D. Handbook of Coins of Macedon and Its Neighbors. Part II: Thrace, Skythia, and Taurike, Sixth to 
First Centuries BC [The Handbook of Greek Coinage Series, Volume 3]. 2017. lxxii and 338 numbered pp. and two maps. 
Hardbound. (GR358) $65 

More than three decades have passed since David Sear published Greek Coins &amp; Their Values, his revision of Gilbert Askew&apos;s A Catalogue 
of Greek Coins published by B. A. Seaby in 1951. Since then, the field of ancient numismatics and the hobby of collecting ancient coins have 
changed so much that now Greek Coins &amp; Their Values would require a complete revision to include all of the most current numismatic infor-
mation available, list the many new types and varieties unknown to Sear, and determine an approximate sense of rarity for all of these issues. 
In order to encompass this new material and create a viable reference for the beginning and specialized collector, such a handbook would 
have to be more than the two volumes which Sear found necessary. As a result, Classical Numismatic Group is publishing The Handbook of 
Greek Coinage Series, written by Oliver D. Hoover, in a series of 13 volumes, each covering a specified area of Greek coinage with the first 
being The Handbook of Syrian Coins: Royal and Civic Issues, Fourth to First Centuries BC (Volume 9 in the series). This series is designed 
to aid the user in the quick, accurate, and relatively painless identification of Greek coins, while providing a cross-reference for each entry to 
a major work, which will allow the inquirer to pursue more in-depth research on the subject. The subject-matter of each volume is arranged 
chronologically for royal issues, and regionally for the civic issues; within each region, cities are listed directionally, depending on the region. 
For those rulers or cities that issued coins concurrently in all three metals, these issues will be arranged in the catalog with gold first, followed 
by silver, and then bronze; each metal is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest. Known mints for the royal coinage are listed below 
the appropriate type, making an easy search for a specific mint. Each entry will include a rarity rating based on the frequency with which 
they appear in publications, public and private collections, the market, and/or are estimated to exist in public or private hands. No valuations 
are listed, since such values are generally out of date by the time of publication. An online valuation guide will allow interested individuals 
the opportunity to gauge the market, and reduce the need for repeated updates of this series. Whether one purchases the entire set for their 
reference library, or the individual volume pertaining to one&apos;s area of specialization, The Handbook of Greek Coinage Series should provide 
a useful staging-point from which collectors and interested scholars can pursue their research and interests. 

The tenth published volume in the series is Handbook of Coins of Macedon and Its Neighbors. Part II: Thrace, Skythia, and Taurike, Sixth 
to First Centuries BC (the second part of Volume 3 in the series). This volume, picking up where Part I leaves off, is arranged first with the 
cities, beginning with Thrace, followed by Skythia and Taurike. These issues are then followed by dynastic and royal coinage, beginning with 
Thrace, followed by Skythia and Taurike. Civic coinage is arranged chronologically, beginning with the Archaic issues and continuing through 
the later civic issues. Where rulers or cities issued coins concurrently in all three metals, these issues will be arranged in the catalog with gold 
first, followed by silver, and then bronze; each metal is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest.

designed to aid the user in the quick, accurate, and relatively painless identification of Greek coins, while providing a cross-reference for each entry to a major work, 
which will allow the inquirer to pursue more in-depth research on the subject. The subject-matter of each volume is arranged chronologically for royal issues, and 
regionally for the civic issues; within each region, cities are listed directionally, depending on the region. For those rulers or cities that issued coins concurrently in all 
three metals, these issues will be arranged in the catalog with gold first, followed by silver, and then bronze; each metal is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest. 
Known mints for the royal coinage are listed below the appropriate type, making an easy search for a specific mint.

The second published volume in the series is Handbook of Coins of the Southern Levant: Phoenicia, Southern Koile Syria (Including Judaea), and Arabia, Fifth to First 
Centuries BC (Volume 10 in the series). This volume is arranged geographically from north to south with each region&apos;s city entries in alphabetical order. The coinage 
within each city is arranged chronologically and begin with the royal issues during the Persian Empire (as is the case with the cities of Phoenicia), through the issues of 
Alexander the Great (both lifetime issues and those later civic issues in his name). Where rulers or cities issued coins concurrently in all three metals, these issues will be 
arranged in the catalog with gold first, followed by silver, and then bronze; each metal is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest.

The seventh published volume in the series is Handbook of Coins of Baktria and Ancient India, Including Sogdiana, Margiana, Areia, and the Indo-Greek, Indo-Skythian, 
and Native Indian States South of the Hindu Kush, Fifth Century Centuries BC to First Century AD (Volume 12 in the series). Beginning with the Kingdom of Baktria, 
the catalog covers all the Graeco-Bakrian and Indo-Greek kings. This volume includes the Indo-Skythian rulers and satraps, as well as the local coinages of the region. 
The Indian coinages south of the Hindu Kush are also included. While not obviously Greek coinage, these issues were struck in the context of their Greek neighbors and 
will add further evidence to the complex monetary systems of the region.
